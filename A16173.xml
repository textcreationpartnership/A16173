            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN READER,</hi> I ſuppoſe it ſhall pleaſe thee better, if I doe entertayne thy ſtudious minde with ſome ſerious diſcourſe, then if I went about to court it, with the ordinary complements of a curious preamble. Wherefore I purpoſe (by thy gentle patience) to handle here a matter of merueilous great importance, which <hi>M. PER.</hi> towardes the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of his booke, layeth out againſt vs in manner of a moſt grieuous complainte: it is, that we <hi>Catholikes,</hi> among many other capitall crimes by vs (as he fableth) defended, doe bolſter and vphold the moſt haynous ſinne of <hi>Atheiſme.</hi> The man is not a litle troubled to deuiſe wherein we doe maintayne any ſuch point of impiety: For compelled by the cleare euidence of truth, he confeſſed that we doe rightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the vnity of the God-head in the Trinity of perſons: yet that he may ſeeme to ſay ſomething therein againſt vs, he flyeth vnto the threed-bare ragges of their common ſlanders of mans merits and ſatisfactions, and ſuch old ſtuffe: and ſtreatching them on the tenter-hookes, yet one nayle further then his fellowes, ſtriueth to drawe out of them a certayne ſtrange kinde of <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>The Roman religion makes the meritte of the workes of men, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with the grace of God, therefore it ouerthrowes the grace of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.</note> Item, <hi>they acknowledge the infinite juſtice and mercy of God, but by conſequence both are denyed: for how can that be infinite juſtice, which may any way be appeaſed by humane ſatisfaction? And howe ſhall Gods mercy be infinite, when we by our owne ſatisfactions muſt adde a ſupply to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt?</hi> There needes a prety witte (I weene) to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand howe theſe points appertayne to <hi>Atheiſme.</hi> For ſuppoſe that we defended, that the meritte of the workes of man concurred with Gods grace, as two diſtinct agents, which we doe not; for we hold that no workes of man haue any meritte, vnleſſe they ſpring and proceede from the very grace of God: but let that be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what kinde of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> or denying of God were this? or howe followeth it thereof, that the grace of God (which is the principall agent, and farre more potent then the other) muſt thereby needes be caſt to the ground and foyled? this is ſo ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimple, that I knowe not what to tearme it: for he doth vntruely ſlander our doctrine, and that to no end and purpoſe. To his ſecond cauill I anſwere in a word,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23774:3"/> that we teach (as he knoweth right well) the infinite juſtice of God to be appeaſed no other way, then by the infinite ſatisfaction of Chriſtes paſsion: And that our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions are onely to pay for the temporall paynes remayning yet due, after the infinite are paide for by Chriſt. Nowe whether any ſuch temporall payne remayne or no, after the ſinne is remitted, is a question betweene vs: but to ſay (as <hi>M. PER.</hi> doth) that we be <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and doe denie God to be God, for that we hold ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment of man to be due, after pardon granted of his greater payne, is moſt apparantly a very ſenceleſſe aſſertion. As wide from all reaſon is his third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: <hi>That Gods mercy cannot be infinite, when by our owne ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we adde a ſupply to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt.</hi> For if Chriſts moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and full ſatisfaction, can well ſtand with Gods infinite mercy; farre more eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may mans ſatisfactions agree with it, which are infinitely leſſe then Chriſtes. But the infinite riches of Gods mercy appeareth eſpecially, in that it pleaſed him freely to giue vnto vs (ſo meane creatures and wreatched ſinners) his owne onely deare Sonne, to be our Redeemer and Sauiour; and both Chriſtes ſatisfaction &amp; ours are rather to be referred vnto Gods juſtice, then to his mercy: wherefore very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfully doth <hi>M. PER.</hi> compare them with Gods mercy. Neither is it poſsible to diſtill any quinteſſence of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> out of it, more then out of the former; nay, they both vprightly weighed, are ſo farre of from <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> or derogating any thing from Gods glory; that they doe much magnifie and aduance the ſame. For albeit we hold our good workes to be both meritorious and ſatisfactory: yet doe we teach the vertue, value, and eſtimation of them, to proceede wholy from the grace of God in vs, whereby we be enabled and holpen to doe them; and not any part of the dignity and worthyneſſe of the workes, to iſſue from the naturall faculty or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the man that doth them. So that when we maintayne the meritte or ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of good workes, we extoll not the nature of man, but doe onely defend and vphold the dignity and vertue of Gods grace: which <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> doe greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe, extenuate and vilifie, not allowing it to be ſufficient to helpe the beſt minded man in the world, to doe any worke that doth not offend God mortally. Thus much concerning our ſuppoſed <hi>Atheiſme</hi> againſt God: nowe of thoſe that be (as he imagineth) againſt Chriſt the Sonne of God: Firſt he argueth thus. <hi>He that hath not the Sonne, hath not the Father: and he that hath neither Father nor Sonne, denies God: now the preſent Roman religion hath not the Sonne, that is</hi> Ieſus Chriſt <hi>God and man: For they in effect aboliſh his man-hood, by teaching of him to haue two kindes of exiſting; one natural in heauen, whereby he is viſible, touchable, and circumſcribed: the other againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby he is ſubſtantially according to his fleſh in the handes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery</hi> Prieſt, <hi>inuiſible and vncircumſcribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwere. <hi>M. PER.</hi> and all <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> knowe right well, that we beleeue <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> to be perfect God, and perfect man, and therefore we haue both the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23774:3"/> Sonne and the Father; and his reaſon againſt it, is not worth a ruſh: for we doe not deſtroy the nature of man, by teaching it to haue two diuers manners of exiſting or being in a place. When Christ was transfigured before his Apostles, he had another manner of outward forme and appearance, then he had before: yet was not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man in him thereby deſtroyed, and after his reſurrection he was (when it pleaſed him) viſible to his Apoſtles, and at other times inuiſible: and yet was not his man-hood thereby aboliſhed, as <hi>M. PER.</hi> would make vs beleeue: no more is it when his body is in many places at once; or in one place circumſcribed, and in the other vncircumſcribed. For theſe externall relations of bodies vnto their places, doe no whit at all deſtroy their inward and naturall ſubſtances, as al Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie teſtifieth: wherefore hence to gather that we denie both the Father and the Sonne to be God, doth ſauour (I will not ſay of a ſilly wit) but of a froward will, peeuiſhly bent to cauill and calumniate. Secondly, <hi>Maſter PERKINS</hi> chargeth vs with diſgrading Chriſt of his offices: ſaying, <hi>that for one</hi> Ieſus Chriſt <hi>the onely King, lawe-giuer, and head of the Church, they joyne vnto him the</hi> Pope, <hi>not only as a Vicar, but as a fellowe, in that they giue vnto him power to make lawes binding in conſcience: to reſolue and determine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly the ſence of holy Scripture: properly to pardon ſinne: to haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer the whole earth, and a part of hell: to depoſe Kinges, to whome vnder Chriſt euery ſoule is ſubject: to abſolue ſubjects from the oath of alleageance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Here is a bed-role of many ſuperfluous ſpeeches: for not one of all theſe thinges (if we admitte them all to be true) doth conuince vs to haue diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chriſt of his offices, which are theſe: to appeaſe Gods wrath towardes vs: to pay the ranſome for our ſinnes: to conquer the Diuell: to open the Kingdome of heauen: to be ſupreme head of both men and Angels, and ſuch like. He may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any derogation vnto theſe his ſoueraigne prerogatiues) giue vnto his ſeruants; firſt, <hi>power to make lawes that binde in conſcience,</hi> as he hath done to all Princes, which the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> themſelues dare not denie: then, <hi>to determine vnfallibly of the true ſence of holy Scripture,</hi> which the Apoſtles could doe, as all men confeſſe; and yet doe not make them Chriſtes fellowes, but his humble ſeruants: to whome alſo <hi>he gaue power properly to pardon ſinnes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 24. Ioan. 20. Mar. 16. Matt. 28.</note> Whoſe ſinnes you pardon on earth, ſbal be pardoned in heauen: and finally, to them he alſo gaue authority ouer the whole earth: <hi>goe into the vniuerſall world.</hi> Ouer part of hell no <hi>Pope</hi> hath authority; and when he doth good to any ſoule in Purgatory, it is <hi>per modum ſuffragij,</hi> as a ſuppliant and entreater, not as a commander. Whether he hath any authority ouer Princes &amp; their ſubjects in temporall affaires, it is queſtioned by ſome: yet no man (not wilfully blinde) can doubt, but that Chriſt might haue giuen him that authority, without diſgrading himſelfe of it; as he hath imparted to him and to others alſo, faculties of greater authority and vertue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23774:4"/> neuertheleſſe the ſame vnto himſelfe, in a much more excellent manner. As a King by ſubſtituting a viceroy, or ſome ſuch like deputie, to whome he giues moſt large commiſsion, doth not thereby diſgrade himſelfe of his Kingly authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as all the world knowes: no more did our Sauiour Christ <hi>Ieſus</hi> bereaue himſelfe of his power or dignity, when he beſtowed ſome part thereof vpon his ſubſtitutes. He goes on multiplying a number of idle wordes to ſmall purpoſe: <hi>as that we for one Chriſt the only</hi> reall Priest <hi>of the newe Teſtament, joyne many ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi> Prieſtes <hi>vnto him, which offer Chriſt daylie in the Maſſe.</hi> We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede hold the Apoſtles to haue beene made by Chriſt, not imputatiue or phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, but <hi>reall</hi> and true <hi>Prieſtes:</hi> And by Christ his owne order and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to haue offered his body and bloud daylie in the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe;</hi> what of that? ſee that question. Furthermore he ſaith, <hi>for one</hi> Ieſus <hi>the all ſufficient mediatour of interceſſion, they haue added many fellowes to him, to make requeſt for vs: namely as many Saintes as be in the</hi> Popes <hi>Kalendar:</hi> yea and many more too. For we hold that any of the faithfull yet liuing, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo requeſted to pray for vs: neither ſhall he in hast be able to proue, that Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh interceſsion for vs, though he be the only mediatour that hath redeemed vs. Laſtly ſaith <hi>M. PERKINS, for the only merittes of Chriſt, in whome alone the Father is well pleaſed,</hi> (what, was he not well pleaſed with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?) <hi>they haue deuiſed a treaſury of the Churches, contayning beſides the merittes of Chriſt, the ouerplus of the merittes of Saints, to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to men at the diſcretion of the</hi> Pope, <hi>and thus we ſee that Chriſt and his merittes be aboliſhed.</hi>

            <p>Anſwere. <hi>Ipſe dixit: Pythagoras</hi> hath pronounced his ſentence; yet you neede not beleeue him, vnleſſe you liſt, becauſe he fableth ſo formally: doth <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> acknowledge that all our worſhip is meere will worſhip, and that it hath no allowance of God? O egregious and impudent deceiuer! <hi>For that learned deuout Author</hi> Durand, <hi>doth nothing elſe in all that booke, then ſet out the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and declared the meaning of the true worſhip of God, vſed daylie in our ſeruice throughout the whole yeare: And therefore doth entitle his booke</hi> Rationale Diuinorum, the reaſons of diuine ſeruice. And as for bodylie rites, we vſe but fewe, and thoſe very decent, full of reuerence, and moſt fit to ſtirre vp and cheriſh deuotion. We be not ſpirits, and therefore muſt ſerue God by bodylie ceremonies, although the life and vertue of them proceede from the ſpirit, employing all partes of the body, in his worſhippe and to his honor that made it: neither be they borrowed of Iewes nor of the Heathens; albeit they might perhaps (the one by the commandement of God, the other by the light of nature) vſe ſome ſuch like: but ours were deuiſed by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt (the heauenly guide and directer of the Catholike Church) to moue vs to ſerue God more deuoutly, and with greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence. Now to ſay that we giue the ſame worſhip to any Saint that we giue to God, is a ſtale jeſt, that hath long ſithence loſt all his grace, being found to be nothing elſe, but a notorious vntruth very often confuted; as by others elſe where, ſo by me more then once in this booke: where alſo theſe other ſlanders here caſt vpon vs, are more at large in their ſeuerall places diſcuſſed: this therefore may ſerue in this place for an anſwere to thoſe imputations of <hi>Atheiſmes,</hi> which <hi>Maſter PERKINS</hi> objecteth against vs. And for that this crime of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> is the most heynous that can be, as contrariewiſe, the true opinion of the God-head and the ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe thereof, is the most ſweete and beautifull flower of religion: let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, here (to hold due correspondence with <hi>Maſter PERKINS</hi>) examine the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> doctrine, concerning the nature of God, and their worſhippe of him; that the indifferent reader, comparing judiciouſlie our two opinions thereof together, may embrace that for moſt pure and true, that carryeth the moſt reuerent and holy conceite thereof. For out of all doubt, there can be no greater motiue to any deuout ſoule, to like of a religion, then to ſee that it doth deliuer a moſt ſacred doctrine
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23774:5"/> of the Soueraigne Lord of heauen and earth, and doth withall moſt religiouſly adore and ſerue him: Whereas on the other ſide, there is not a more forcible perſuaſion to forſake a religion before profeſſed, then to be giuen to vnderſtand, that the Maſters of that religion, teach many abſurde thinges concerning the God-head it ſelfe, and doe as coldly and as ſlightly worſhippe God almighty; as may be.

And in this he is defended by</hi> M. Whitaker, <hi>and preferred before all the learned Fathers of the firſt councell of</hi> Nice. Out of which poſition it followeth, that there is neither Father nor Sonne in the God-head: for according vnto common ſence, and the vniforme conſent of all the learned; he only is a true naturall Sonne, that by generation doth receiue his nature and ſubſtance from his Father. We are called the Sonnes of God, but that is by adoption and grace: but he only is the true naturall Sonne of God, that by eternall generation receiued his ſubſtance: that is, the God-head from him. If therefore the ſecond perſon did not receiue the God-head from the firſt, but had it of himſelfe, as they doe affirme: then certaynelie he is no true Sonne of the firſt, and conſequently the firſt perſon is no true Father. For (as all men confeſſe) Father &amp; Sonne be <hi>correlatiues,</hi> ſo that the one cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other. Thus their doctrine is found to be faulty in the higheſt degree of <hi>Atheiſme.</hi> For it ouerthroweth both Father and Sonne in the Trinity. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it were true, then doth the holy Ghoſt proceede neither from the Father, nor from the Sonne: for it receiueth not the God-head from them at all, as they hold; but hath it of himſelfe, and ſo proceedeth no more from them, then they doe from him, &amp; conſequently is not the third perſon: Wherefore finally they doe ouerthrowe the whole Trinity, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost.

Ioyne here vnto that they doe expound moſt of the textes of holy Scripture, vſed by the auncient Fathers to proue the bleſſed &amp; ſacred Trinity, euen as the old <hi>Arrians</hi> did, reprouing the auncient Fathers expoſition; which cannot but argue, that they in their hartes (though they be yet aſhamed to confeſſe it) decline apace from thoſe holy Fathers ſteps, to fauour <hi>Arrianiſme.</hi> This litle therefore may ſuffice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, howe the chiefe pillers of the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> religion, doe ſhake the very foundations of the Chriſtian faith, by their ſtrange gloſſes and ſpeeches about the ſacred Trinity, and by their diuers derogations to Chriſtes diuinity. But this ſhall appeare yet much more perſpiciouſly, if we doe well weigh what they teach touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very nature of the God-head it ſelfe.

            <p>Another opinion ſome of them hold, which is yet much more blaſphemous then the other, to wit: that God, who hath beene alwaies by good men eſteemed the author of all good, and ſo meerely good in his owne nature and will, that he cannot poſsibly doe or thinke any euill: that this Ocean (I ſay) of goodneſſe, is become <hi>the author, plotter, promoter, and worker of all the wickedneſſe and miſchiefe, that is, or hath beene committed in the world.</hi> This is the doctrine of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> a great Rabin among the newe Gospellers,<note place="margin">De pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.

               <hi>as the calling of</hi> Paul. But the principall proctor and promoter of this blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is <hi>Caluin,</hi> who of ſet purpoſe beſtowes a whole chapter of his Inſtitutions, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23774:6"/> hell, to proue and perſwade it. There he auoucheth boldly, <hi>that the blinding and madneſſe of</hi> Achab, <hi>was the will and decree of God: that</hi> Abſolon <hi>indeede defiling his fathers bed with inceſtuous adultery, committed deteſtable wickednes; yet this was Gods owne worke:</hi> briefly, <hi>that nothing is more plaine, then that God blindeth the eies of men, ſtriketh them with giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, maketh them drunke, caſteth them into madnes, and hardneth their harts.</hi> And whereas the poore <hi>Papiſts</hi> were wont to interprete ſuch textes of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as ſeeme to attribute theſe thinges to God, by ſaying, that God doth indeede juſtly <hi>permit,</hi> and <hi>ſuffer ſuch thinges</hi> to be done, but is not the author of them: this, <hi>Caluin</hi> will not in any wiſe admitte of, but in the ſame place confutes it; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Theſe thinges many referre to ſufferance, as if in forſaking the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, he ſuffered them to be blinded by</hi> Satan: <hi>but that ſolution</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is too fond,</hi> and ſo goeth on, prouing that God doth not only ſuffer, but <hi>actually effect and worke all the euill,</hi> that any man committeth: yea, he addeth that which is more horrible: that God doth worke this euill in man,<note place="margin">Ibidem ſeſſ. 17. 2.</note> 
               <hi>by</hi> Satans <hi>ſeruice as a meane; yet ſo as God is the principall worker of it, and the Diuell but his inſtrument.</hi> Is not this blaſphemy in the higheſt degree, to make God a more principall author, and worker of all wickedneſſe, done in the world, then the Diuell himſelfe? this is much worſe then flat <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> for it is the leſſer impiety of two to hold that there is no God at all, then to beleeue that God worketh more effectually all miſchiefe, then the infernal ſpirits doe. But ſome of our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> wil perhaps ſay, that they hold not this opinion: be it ſo, for I thinke better of many of them: yet, be not theſe men that ſo teach, as it were the founders of the newe Gospell, and men of chiefeſt marke among them? Nowe what force ſuch principall authours (as they take <hi>Melancthon, Zwinglius, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> to be) may haue, to carry the rest away into the ſame errours, I knowe not. Sure I am, that <hi>Caluins</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions (wherein this matter is ſo vehemently vrged) is tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and in the Preface commended to all ſtudents of Christian diuinity, as one of the moſt profitable (the holy Scriptures excepted) for the ſound declarations of truth in articles of religion.</p>
            <p>But to proceede on with this diſcourſe: the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe not only impugne the power &amp; goodnes of God: but they doe alſo peruert his juſtice. For to omit their laſt poſition, that God is the worker of al ſinne in vs <hi>compelling</hi> (as <hi>Caluin</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>the reprobate to obedience;</hi> and therefore cannot in juſtice puniſh the poore wreatches, for being obedient vnto his owne will and working: and not to vrge their former aſſertion, that <hi>God of his owne wil &amp; decree, hath predeſtinated the greater part of men to hell, without any foreſight of their euill deſertes:</hi> which if it were true, ſhould it not be intolerable wronge, to torment ſo rigorouſly innocents, that neuer offended him? To let paſſe theſe points (I ſay) how can they defend the juſtice of God, who hold that he hath tyed vs to ſuch lawes, as are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23774:7"/> to be kept by any man? For Christ (as he teſtified himſelfe) will condemne men to hell fire for tranſgreſsing of theſe lawes,<note place="margin">Math. 7. verſ. 23.</note> by working of iniquity; <hi>depart from me you that worke iniquity:</hi> and what equity ſhould there be in that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, if it had neuer beene poſsible for theſe men to haue done otherwiſe? For no reaſonable Iudge condemneth any man for not doing of that, which he knewe well, lay not any way in his power to be done. So that nothing is more plaine and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then that the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> doctrine trotteth apace towardes open <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> by impugning the power of God: by defacing his goodneſſe, mercy, and justice, which in our vnderſtanding are the chiefe properties of his diuine ſubstance: and by calling into queſtion the bleſſed Trinity it ſelfe, which their of-ſpring and progeny the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> doe already denie flatly.</p>
            <p>Thus much of their <hi>Atheiſmes</hi> against God. Nowe to thoſe that be against our Sauiour Chriſt <hi>Ieſus:</hi> I haue before touched their errors concerning his God-head; here I will ſpeake of thoſe that be againſt his Man-hood, and Mediatorſhip. First, it muſt needes argue in them a great want of good affection towardes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, that they are ſo backward in his bleſſed Mother the holy Virgins praiſes, not hearing with patience, any body that would ſo much as ſalute her with the <hi>Haile MARY,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> which notwithſtanding is recorded in the Gospell? and are beſides ſo ready vpon euery litle occaſion, to ſpeake in her diſpraiſe, that we may with good reaſon reproue them, as men either wanting judgement (which they will not endure of anything) or elſe voide of due reſpect vnto the Sonne, who are ſuch aduerſaries to the Mother: whome if they would not reuerence for her owne vertues, which were most rare and ſinguler; yet for her Sonnes ſake (who loued her ſo tenderly) they ſhould ſhewe themſelues better affected towardes her, and more forward in her praiſes, if they did indeede loue and honour her Sonne, as they pretend to doe.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to Chriſtes owne perſon. Whereas the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was (at the firſt inſtance of his creation) repleniſhed with perfect knowledge: and it is alſo in holy write ſaid of the ſecond,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. In cap. 2. Lu. v. 52. Colloſ. 2. verſ. 4.</note>

               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. verſ. 39.</note> He obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth first, <hi>that this prayer of Chriſt was vnaduiſedly made:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>that he ouercome with griefe, had forgotten the heauenly decree, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring for the time, that he was ſent to be the redeemer of mankinde:</hi> thirdly, <hi>that he withſtood as much as in him lay, and refuſed to execute the office of a mediator.</hi> See <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo vpon theſe wordes of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. verſ. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Father ſaue me from this houre:</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt was ſo ſtrooken with feare, and ſo pinched on euery ſide with perplexed penſiueneſſe, that he was forced through theſe boiſterous waues of temptation, to wauer and fleete too and fro in his prayers and petitions.</hi> Is not this pittifull impiety? Whereas our moſt louing redeemer, of ſet purpoſe tooke that feare vpon him, and moſt willingly both ſuffered, and cauſed that bloudy agony and conflict, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting vnto him ſelfe, both the ſhame and paine of his dolorous paſsion, and the cauſes thereof (which were the innumerable moſt grieuous ſinnes of the world) that he might in euery part both of minde and body, endure what he poſsibly could, for the time; and ſpake nothing raſhly, but repeated that his prayer ouer three ſeuerall times, as is ſet downe in the text it ſelfe; to ſhewe vs howe naturally he (as all other men) did abhorre ſuch a cruell and ignominious death: and yet withall to inſtruct vs, that we ſhould be content with it, and pray to God for ſtrength to beare it, if it were his bleſſed will to put vs to the like. This holeſome doctrine and Godly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, are by the auncient holy Fathers gathered out of that prayer of Chriſt: what a venemous ſpider then was <hi>Caluin,</hi> to ſucke ſuch poiſon out of it? if Chriſt ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, where was his conſtancy? if he were ſo frighted (as <hi>Caluin</hi> falſly imagineth) where was his fortitude? if he ſtrugled ſo againſt his Fathers decree, where was his obedience? if he refuſed to redeeme vs, what was become of his charity towardes mankinde? if the firſt motions to euill be deadly ſinnes in vs (as the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> hold) what will they make of ſuch tumultuous, and vnbridled paſsions in him, that had a greater command ouer them, then we haue? But we are not yet come vnto the hight of his blaſphemies, which he powreth forth more aboundantly vpon thoſe our Sauiours wordes: <hi>My GOD, my GOD, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27. verſ. 46.</note> ſaying: <hi>when this kinde of temptation was propoſed to Chriſt (as though God being auerted from him, he had beene appointed to vtter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) he was ſeiſed with horror.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Li. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. c. 16. ſeſſ. 11.</note> And in his <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> treating of the ſame
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23774:8"/> ſubject, ſaith: <hi>Chriſt feared to haue beene ſwallowed vp of death as a ſinner: And there can be no more dreadfull bottomeleſſe gulfe, then for a man to feele himſelfe forſaken and eſtranged from God, &amp; not to be heard, when he calleth vpon him, euen as if God had conſpired his deſtruction: euen thither we ſee that Chriſt was throwne downe, ſo that by enforcement of diſtreſſe he was compelled to crie out: my GOD, my GOD, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> In the Paragraffe before, he ſpeaketh more plainely, <hi>that Chriſt did hand in hand wreſtle with the armies of hel, &amp; the horror of eternal death:</hi> finally, <hi>that in his ſoule he ſuffered the torments of the damned, and al thoſe puniſhments that are due to wicked men in hell:</hi> He then (belike) was the traytor <hi>Iudas</hi> companion: for the while he was in the Diuels handes to be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be <hi>deſpaired and fared</hi> as men doe in theſe helliſh torments. What greater blaſphemy can be inuented, then to condemne the King of heauen, that came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs all from hell, euen to the very pitte of hell it ſelfe? <hi>Beza</hi> not willing to come behinde his maſter <hi>Caluin</hi> in this kinde of impiety, whereas <hi>Caluin</hi> craftily admitted only,<note place="margin">In cap. 5. ad Hebr. verſ. 7.</note> that Chriſt then deſpaired, he affirmeth plainely: <hi>that from Chriſt (ſtrooken with the horror of Gods curſe) eſcaped the word of deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And elſe where, <hi>that Chriſt was (with the huge heauie burden of Gods wrath, ouerwhelmed and adjudged to the flames of hell: yea, buried and drowned in the bottome of the infernall gulfe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">In ca. 27. Math. &amp; 22. Luc.</note> This man (you ſee) deſires to lodge Chriſt lowe enough, that would haue him drowned in the very bottome of hell.

               <hi>What ſhall we therefore ſay? Chriſt to haue bin togither both the moſt juſt, and greateſt ſinner: both the moſt notorious lier, and trueſt teacher: at the ſame inſtant, both the moſt highly glorying, &amp; deepely deſpairing: both happy in the higheſt degree, &amp; moſt miſerably damned. Vnleſſe we ſay this, I ſee not</hi> (ſaith this Oracle of the newe Goſpell) <hi>howe Chriſt was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God.</hi> See him alſo vpon the third chapter to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he vttereth yet more deteſtable ſpeaches of Chriſt, to wit: <hi>that all the Prophets did in the ſpirit foreſee him to be the greateſt theefe, robber, murtherer, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, ſacrilegious perſon and blaſphemer, that euer liued.</hi> I could cite you diuers others of the ſame opinion, but I had rather note their extreame blindneſſe, who neglecting the auncient Fathers learned expoſitions of the holy Scriptures, were ledde away with ſuch horrible extrauagant conceites of our Sauiour, vpon ſo ſmall occaſion. For he at that very time hanging on the Croſſe, declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be moſt farre of from all ſuch helliſh torments: yea, he ſhewed all poſsible ſignes of a moſt quiet and peaceable minde, praying for the ſaluation euen of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors (he was not then belike in doubt of his owne) promiſing alſo to the good theefe that the ſame day he ſhould be with him in Paradiſe; wherefore he doubted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23774:8"/> nothing of being there himſelfe: recommending his Mother vnto his beloued Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and him likewiſe to her; and to fulfill the Scriptures, both ſaying <hi>I thirſt,</hi> and citing euen thoſe very wordes, that they are ſcandalized at, out of one of the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid:</hi> And finally, aduiſedly conſidering all thinges belonging to his paſsion, to be accompliſhed, commended his ſpirit vnto his Fathers handes; ſo that there could not poſsibly be more calme ſetled judgement, more valiant conſtancy &amp; reſolution, then there was. But what ment he then to ſay, <hi>my GOD, my GOD, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Forſooth nothing elſe, but to ſignifie, that in all theſe torments which he ſuffered, he had not any comfort or conſolation at that time from God, who is wont to giue extraordinary aide and comfort to all thoſe, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his names ſake: but that Christ might (as he himſelfe deſired) be put to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all kinde of extremity, all manner of inward conſolation was wholely with-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from him; which it pleaſed him then to expreſſe by manner of complainte in thoſe moſt pittifull wordes: <hi>My GOD, my GOD, &amp;c.</hi> the more to moue vs to compaſsion. Thus much of their impieties against Chriſtes perſon: nowe to thoſe that they teach againſt the office of his mediatorſhippe.</p>
            <p>They hold first, that whatſoeuer our Sauiour did or ſuffered before his paſsion, was of ſmal value for our redemption. For as a noble <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſaid, <hi>the</hi> Monkes,<note place="margin">Moline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia, part. 51.</note> Prieſtes, <hi>and</hi> Papiſticall <hi>Doctors did erre, when they vrged Chriſtes incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and natiuity: for all theſe thinges profited vs nothing; could doe nothing: but only the death of Chriſt, which alone was accepted of God for our ſinnes.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Caluin</hi> goeth further, and doubteth not to ſay, <hi>that Chriſtes paſſion and corporall death would not ſerue the turne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Li. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. ca. 16 ſeſſ. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and had profited vs nothing at all, had he not in his ſoule ſuffered the very paines of the damned in hell.</hi> This doctrine of theirs is not only contrary to an hundreth places of expreſſe Scripture, that doe aſsigne our redemption vnto the bloud-ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and paſsion of Christ: but it alſo derogateth very much from the dignity of our Mediatour. For not that which he ſuffered, made the meritte of our redemption: but it was his exceeding charity, with which he ſuffered it, and principally the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dignity of his diuine perſon, which gaue that value, price, and eſtimation to his ſufferinges, that the very least thing that euer he ſuffered in his life, was of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value; and therefore ſufficient to pay the ranſome of all mankinde: yea, to haue redeemed a thouſand worldes. But let vs proceede on with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes</hi> opinion: did Christes ſufferinges of the tormentes of hell deſerue of God in juſtice, the redemption of man? not ſo, if we may beleeue one of <hi>Foxes</hi> Martirs, <hi>who held</hi> (as he recordeth) <hi>that Chriſt with all his workes could not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritte heauen for vs.</hi> But for that litle credit is to be giuen to ſuch a <hi>Martir,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes &amp; monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. pag. 487</note> and ſuch a <hi>Martir-monger,</hi> let vs heare what ſome of the learneſt amongſt them ſay. <hi>I truly confeſſe</hi> (ſaith Caluin) <hi>that if a man will ſet Chriſt ſingly and by himſelfe, againſt the judgements of God, there wil be no roome for merit.</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:23774:9"/> And after:<note place="margin">L. 2. Inſti. c. 17. ſſ. 1. In abſter. calumni. Heſhu.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt could not deſerue any thing, but by the good pleaſure of God.</hi> Finally, <hi>the deſeruinges of Chriſt depend vpon the only grace of God,</hi> which is defended by his diſciple <hi>Beza</hi> against <hi>Heſhuſius:</hi> ſo that briefly, all Chriſtes ſufferinges in hell and out of hell, in true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> reckoning, amount to no higher a value, then that by the good pleaſure and acceptance of God, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued our redemption; therefore in rigour of justice they were not of ſufficient worth to redeeme vs, but were only of grace, by God accepted for ſuch. Is not here a faire reckoning? ſo might any other man endued with grace, haue redeemed al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde as well as Chriſt, if it had pleaſed God to haue ſo accepted it; ſeing no equall recompence was to be expected. But to helpe him here by the way, that could not vnderſtand howe we were ſaued by the mercy of God: if Chriſtes merittes did in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice deſerue our ſaluation, it is to be noted that both be true, if they be duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. For we are ſaued by Chriſtes merits in rigour of justice, he ſatisfying of God as far-forth fully, as we offended him: and yet we be ſaued freely by the mercy of God too; both, becauſe he hath of his meere mercy without any deſert of ours, giuen vs Christ his Sonne to be our Sauiour: and alſo for that he hath (out of the ſame his mercy) freely applyed vnto euery one in particuler that is ſaued, the merits of Chriſt, through which he is ſaued.</p>
            <p>To returne to our purpoſe, and to diſcouer yet more of the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> diſgraces offered to our Sauiours mediation. Did Chriſt ſuffer his paſsion for the redemption of all mankinde,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Heſh pag. 39. Sup. Ioh. pag. 39. In locis fol. 361. 1. Ioh. 2. verſ. 2.</note> or did he die only for ſome fewe of the elect? let <hi>Caluin</hi> anſwere you. <hi>Chriſtes fleſh was not crucified for the vngodly, neither was the bloud of Chriſt ſhed to clenſe their ſinnes.</hi> With him agreeth brother <hi>Bucer: Chriſt by his death did only redeeme the ſinnes of the elect.</hi> Muſculus wil beare a part in that conſort: <hi>Chriſtes death is a ſatisfaction only for the ſinnes of the elect;</hi> all as contrary to the plaine text of Scripture, as can be. <hi>Chriſt is a propitiation for our ſinnes</hi> (where he ſpake in the perſon of the elect) <hi>and not for ours only, but alſo for the whole worldes.</hi> Let vs goe on yet one ſtep further. What effect doth the bloud of Christ worke in the ſmall number of theſe elected bretheren? Doth it cleanſe their ſoules from al filth of ſinne, and powre into them the manifold giftes of the holy Ghoſt, whereby they may afterward reſiſt ſinne,<note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> and ſerue God in holyneſſe of life? nothing leſſe. <hi>For in the regenerate</hi> (as <hi>M. PERKINS</hi> with all the reſt of them doth teach) <hi>there remaineth originall ſinne, which infecteth euery worke of man, and maketh it a mortall ſinne.</hi> So that inwardly in their ſoules theſe elected <hi>Proteſtantes,</hi> be voide of justice, and full of all manner of iniquity: marry, they haue created in them the rare inſtrument of a newe deuiſed faith, by which they lay hold on Chriſtes juſtice, and ſo by reall imputation (to vſe <hi>M. PERKINS</hi> wordes) of Chriſtes juſtice to them, they on the ſoddaine become exceeding just: therefore Frier <hi>Luther</hi> had ſome reaſon to ſay, that whoſoeuer was borne againe of this Euangelicall faith, <hi>was equall in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23774:9"/> grace vnto both</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul;<note place="margin">Supra 1. Pet. 1. In actis diſput. Tigur. Fox Act. fol. 1335. &amp; 1138.</note> 
               <hi>and vnto the Virgin MARY Mother of God:</hi> Nay, it ſeemes that <hi>Luther</hi> came to ſhort, and <hi>Zwinglius</hi> ſtrooke home when he ſaid: <hi>that God the Father did no leſſe fauour all the faithfull, then he did Chriſt his owne Sonne.</hi> And out of the confidence of the ſame liuely-fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling faith, proceeded theſe ſpeaches of our newe Gospellers in <hi>England. And we haue as much right to heauen, as Chriſt hath; we cannot be damned, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Chriſt be damned: neither can Chriſt be ſaued, vnleſſe we be ſaued.</hi> Christ (belike) could not liue in bliſſe without their holy company. What audacious compagnions, and ſaucy Goſpellers were theſe? yet their reaſon ſeemeth ſound in the way of their owne religion: for if they were moſt aſſured of the benefit of Chriſts owne juſtice to be imputed vnto them, they could not be leſſe aſſured of their owne ſaluation, then they were of Chriſtes owne. To conclude this point, conſider (good reader) howe the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> (who would be thought to magnifie Christes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings exceedingly) doe in very deede extreamely debaſe them. For (as you haue heard) they eſteeme very litle of all the reſt of his life, beſides his paſsion: ſecondly, they make his paſsion without ſuffering of hell tormentes, not ſufficient to redeeme vs: thirdly, that all thoſe ſufferings put togither, doe not in justice merit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of our ſinnes, but only that of grace and curteſie, God doth accept them for ſuch: fourthly, that when all is done, they deſerue fauour only for a few of the elect, and that not to purge thoſe fewe neither from all their ſinnes, but only to purchaſe them an imputation of juſtice, to be apprehended by a ſtrong imagination or rather preſumption, falſly by them tearmed faith. Is not here a huge great mill-post, faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thwited into a poore pudding pricke (as they ſay) by them, who after ſo high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations of the all-ſufficiency of Chriſtes ſuffering, doe in fine conclude, that in a very fewe perſons it worketh only an imputation or ſhadowe of justice: but it agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very well and hangeth handſomely together, that by the merits of Chriſtes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in hell, (which are meere phantaſticall) theſe men ſhould haue created in them a phantaſticall faith, neuer heard of before their dayes, to lay-hold vpon a vaine ſhadowe of an imputatiue and phantaſticall justice.</p>
            <p>But to returne vnto Chriſtes mediatorſhip and merits. Is it not moreouer a great diſparagement vnto them, to maintayne (as the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> doe) that his beſt-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued ſpouſe the Church, ſhould continue but a ſmall time, at leaſt in any ſight, and ſhould be penned vp in corners: yea, and during that time too, it ſhould not be free from many foule groſſe errours, in the very foundation of faith? Furthermore, that he left his holy word (the only rule and ſquare (as they hold) of Christian religion) to be vnderſtood of euery man as his owne knowledge and ſpirit ſhould direct him? and if any doubtfull question did ariſe there about (as he fore-ſawe thouſandes ſhould doe) yet he tooke no other order for the deciding and ending of them, but that euery one ſhould repaire vnto the ſame his word, and doing his diligence to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, might afterward be his owne judge. As this later opinion would argue our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23774:10"/> bleſſed Sauiour, who was the wiſedome of God, to be the weakeſt and moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident lawe-maker that euer was: ſo the former doth mightily blemiſh the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable price of his most pretious bloud, making it not of ſufficient value, to purchaſe vnto him an euerlasting inheritance, free from all errours in matter of faith, and abounding in all good workes.</p>
            <p>To fold vp this part, let me entreate thee <hi>(curteous reader)</hi> to be an vpright judge betweene the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> doctrine and ours, in this most weighty matter of Chriſtes dignity, vertues, and mediation; and if thou ſee moſt euidently, that ours doth more aduance them, why ſhouldeſt thou not giue ſentence on our ſide? They make Christ ignorant many yeares of his life: we hold him from the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his conception, to haue beene repleniſhed with most perfect knowledge. They, that he ſpake and taught nowe and then, as other men did; and was ſubject to diſordinate paſsions: We, that he was most free from all ſuch, and that he taught alwaies moſt diuinely. They make his very death not ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs: we hold that the leaſt thing that euer he ſuffered in his life, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the redemption of many worldes. They, that he died only for the elect: we, that he died for all, though many through their owne fault, doe not receiue any benefit by his death. They, that thereby we are not purged from our ſinnes, but by imputation: we, that all are by the vertue thereof inwardly cleanſed. They, that Christ purchaſed a Church conſisting of fewe, not to continue long, and ſubject to many errours: we, that he eſtabliſhed a Church, that ſhould be ſpredde ouer all the world, and that ſhould continue to the end of the world viſibly, and alwaies free from any errour in any matter of faith. Finally, they hold that Christ left his holy word to the disputation of men, not taking any certaine order for the ending of controuerſies, that ſhould ariſe about it: we teach, that he hath eſtabliſhed a most aſſured meanes, to decide all doubtes in religion, and to hold all obedient Christians in perfect vniformity, of both faith and manners. And becauſe I am entred into theſe compariſons, giue me leaue to perſiſt yet a litle longer in them. Conſider alſo (I pray you) who goe neerer to <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> either we, that thinke and ſpeake of the moſt ſacred Trinity, as the bleſſed Fathers in the first Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> taught: or they, who directly croſſe them, and by the nouelty of their phraſes, doe breed newe, or rather reuiue old hereſies against it. Againe, who carry a more holy conceit of God, either they, who vpon light occaſion doe raſhly denie God to be able to doe that, which they doe not conceiue poſsible: or we, that teach him to be able to doe tenne thouſand thinges, that paſſe our vnderſtanding. Whither they, that affirme God of his owne free choiſe, to caſt away the greater part of men: or we, that defend him to deſire the ſaluation of all men, and not to be willing that any one periſh, vnleſſe it be through his owne default. Either they, that hold him to be the authour of all euill done in the world, and the Diuell to be but his Minister
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23774:10"/> therein: or we, that maintayne him to be ſo purely good, that he cannot poſsibly either concurre to any euill, or ſo much as once to thinke to doe any euill. Finally, whoſe opinion of him is better, either ours, that hold him to haue beene ſo reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in framing of his lawes, that he doth by his grace make them eaſie to a willing minde: or theirs, that auouch him to haue giuen lawes impoſsible for the beſt men to keepe? If ſome <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> doe ſay, we doe not maintayne diuers of theſe poſitions. I anſwere that it is, becauſe they doe yet in part hold with vs, and are not ſo farre gone, as they doe wholy followe their newe masters: For if they did, then ſhould they embrace all the afore-ſaid damnable poſitions, being ſo plainely taught by their principall preachers and teachers. Theſe therefore are to warne my deere Country-men, to looke to it in time; and then (no doubt) but that all ſuch as haue a ſufficient care of their ſaluation, conſidering maturely whither the current and ſtreame of the newe Gospell carrieth them, will ſpeedily diſbarke themſelues thence, least at length they be driuen by it, into the bottomeleſſe gulfe of flat <hi>Atheiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is it any great meruaile, that the common ſort of the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> fall into ſo many foule abſurdities touching religion, when as the very fountaines, out of which they pretend to take their religion, be ſo pittifully corrupted? I meane the ſacred word of God. Master <hi>Gregory Martin</hi> a <hi>Catholike</hi> man, very ſkilfull in the learned languages, hath diſcouered about two hundreth of their corruptions of the very text of Gods word: and after him one Master <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> a man of their owne (eſteemed to be ſingulerly ſeene in the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue) hath aduertiſed them of more then eight hundreth faultes there in. And the matter is ſo euident, that the Kinges Majeſtie, in that publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference holden at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> in the firſt of his raigne, confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not to haue ſeene one true tranſlation of the <hi>Bible</hi> in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and that of <hi>Geneua,</hi> which they were wont to eſteeme moſt, to be the worst of all others: and therefore commanded them to goe in hand with a newe tranſlation; about which, fifty of the moſt learned amongſt them in both Vniuerſities (as it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly reported) haue this three yeares trauailed, and cannot yet hitte vpon, or elſe not agree vpon, a newe ſincere and true tranſlation. Here is a large field offered me to exclaime againſt ſuch corrupters and deprauers of Gods ſacred word: but I will leaue that to ſome other time, becauſe I haue beene to long already. But what a lamentable caſe is this! they hold for the most aſſured piller of their faith, that all matters of ſaluation muſt be fiſhed out of the Scriptures, and crie vpon all men to ſearch the Scriptures: and yet are the ſame Scriptures by themſelues ſo peruerſly mangled, that their owne pew-fellowes crie out ſhame vpon them therefore: wherevnto (if it pleaſe you) joyne, that the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> haue no aſſured meanes to be reſolued of ſuch doubtes and difficulties, as they ſhall find in the ſame word of God. For they muſt neither truſt ancient Father,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23774:11"/> nor relie vpon the determination, either of nationall or generall Councell; but euery faithfull man (by himſelfe) examining the circumſtances of the text, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring other like places vnto it together, ſhall finde out the right meaning of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure ſentences, as they moſt childiſhly beare their followers in hand. Briefly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, a great number of them hauing Gods word corrupted, for the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne to their feete; and their owne dimme ſight, for their best guide: no maruaile, though they ſtumble at many difficulties in theſe high miſteries, and fall into very abſurd opinions, concerning the principall partes of them.</p>
            <p>Nowe to make vp an euen reckoning with <hi>M. PER. Atheiſme,</hi> I muſt come vnto their diuine ſeruice and worſhip of God, the third point that I promiſed to handle; becauſe he ſpared not to ſpeake his pleaſure of ours. First then, whereas a true, reall, and externall ſacrifice, is among all externall workes, the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſeruice that can be done to the diuine Majeſtie, as ſhall be proued in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the ſacrifice; which alſo hath euer ſince the beginning of the world, beene by the beſt men practiſed, to acknowledge and teſtifie, aſwell the ſoueraigne domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that God hath ouer vs, as our dutifull ſubjection vnto his almighty goodneſſe: the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> to make knowne vnto the wiſer ſorte, that they are not Gods true loyall people, will not vouchſafe to performe to him any ſuch ſpeciall ſeruice, as to ſacrifice in his honour: nay they are fallen ſo farre out with this principall part of Gods true worſhip, that they doe in deſpite of it, powre out moſt vile reproches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the daylie ſacrifice of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, which contayneth the bleſſed body and moſt pretious bloud of our redeemer <hi>IESVS</hi> Christ. Secondly, of ſeauen Sacraments (inſtituted by our Sauiour, both to exhibite honour to God, and to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie our ſoules) they doe flatly reject fiue of them: And doe further (as much as in them lieth) extinguiſh the vertue and efficacy of the other two. For they hold Baptiſme not to be the true inſtrumentall cauſe of remiſsion of our ſinnes, and of the infuſion of grace into our ſoules; but only to be the ſigne and ſeale thereof. And in ſteade of Christes ſacred body, really giuen to all <hi>Catholikes</hi> in the Sacrament of the Altar, to their exceeding comfort and dignity, the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take vp with a bitte of bread, and with a ſuppe of wine: a most pittifull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, for ſo heauenly a banquet. They doe daylie feele (and I would to God they had grace to vnderſtand) what a want they haue of the Sacrament of Confeſsion, which is the most ſoueraigne ſalue of the world, to cure all the deadly and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous woundes of the ſoule. Ah howe careſty doe they daylie heape ſinne vpon ſinne, and ſuffer them to lie feſtring in their breastes euen till death, for lacke of launcing them in ſeaſon by true and due confeſsion! Beſides, at the point of death, when the Diuell is most buſie to aſſault vs, labouring then to make vs his owne for euer, there is amongſt them no <hi>anointing of the ſicke with</hi> holy <hi>oile</hi> in the name of our Lord, (as <hi>S. Iames</hi> preſcribeth) <hi>joyned with the</hi> Priestes <hi>prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 5. verſ. 14.</note> which ſhould <hi>ſaue the ſicke,</hi> and by meanes whereof <hi>his ſinnes ſhould be forgiuen, and he lifted
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23774:11"/> vp</hi> by our Lord, and inwardly both greatly comforted and ſtrengthned: theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly helpes (I ſay) and many others, which our <hi>Catholike</hi> religion afford vnto all perſons, &amp; by which rightly adminiſtred, God is highly magnified, are quite baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> territories, and conſequently their religion for want of them, is mightily maymed. They haue yet remayning ſome poore ſhort prayers to be ſaid twiſe a weeke: for fearing (belike) to make their Ministers ſurfette of ouer much praying, they will not tie them to any daylie prayers: <hi>Mattins, Euenſong,</hi> and other ſet <hi>houres</hi> they leaue to the <hi>Prieſtes,</hi> ſauing that on the Sabbaoth they ſolemnely meete together at the Church, to ſay their ſeruice, which is a certayne mingle-mangle, tranſlated out of the old <hi>portaiſe</hi> and <hi>Maſſe</hi> booke, patched vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome fewe of their owne inuentions. And though it be but ſhort, yet it is (the Lord he knowes) performed by moſt of them ſo ſlightly, that an indifferent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, would rather judge them to come thither to gaſe one vpon another, or to common of worldly buſineſſe, then reuerently there to ſerue God. Nowe as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the place where their diuine ſeruice is ſaid: if goodly ſtately Churches, had not beene by men of our religion built to their handes, in what ſimple cotes (trowe you) would their key-cold deuotion haue beene content to ſerue their Lord? if one Church or great ſteeple, by any miſhap fall into vtter ruine, a collection throughout all <hi>England</hi> for many yeares together, will not ſerue to build it vp againe: which maketh men of judgement to perceiue, that their religion is exceeding cold in the ſetting foreward of good workes, and that it rather tendeth to deſtruction, then to edification. Againe, whereas our Churches are furniſhed with many goodly Altars, trimmed vp decently, and garniſhed with ſundry faire and religious pictures, to ſtrike into the beholders a reuerent respect of that place, and to drawe them to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meditations: theirs haue ordinarely bare walles, hanged with cob-webs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome of the better ſort, which are daubed like Ale-houſes, with ſome broken ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Scripture. Beſides, the ancient custome of Chriſtians, being to pray with their faces towardes the Sunne riſing, to ſhewe the hope they haue of a good reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and that by tradition receiued euen from the Apostles, as witneſſeth Saint <hi>Baſil:</hi> their Miniſters in their higheſt miſteries,<note place="margin">De Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto. 27.</note> looke ouer their communion table into the South: to ſignifie (perhaps) that their ſpirituall eſtate is now at the higheſt, and that in their religion there is no hope of riſing towardes heauen, but aſſurance of declining.</p>
            <p>I may not here omitte, that of late yeares they haue cauſed the Kinges armes to be ſet vp in the place, where Christes armes the Crucifix was wont to ſtand: the which I confeſſe would haue graced their Church better, if it had beene elſe where placed. But I hope they will giue me leaue to aſke them, howe they durſt ſet vp any ſuch Images in their Churches, as be in that armes. For they haue taught hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, that it is expreſly againſt the ſecond commandement, and a kind of Idolatry, not only to worſhippe Images; but alſo to ſet them vp in Churches: and yet nowe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23774:12"/> (as it were) cleane forgetting themſelues, they fall into that fault themſelues, that they haue ſo much blamed in others. Neither will it helpe them to ſay, that they reproued only the ſetting vp of holy pictures, but not of others. For the ſecond commandement (as they expound it) is aſwell againſt the one as the other, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding generally the making of any kind of Image. And is it not a pittifull blindneſſe to thinke, that the pictures of Lions and Liberts doe better become the houſe of God, then the Image of his owne Sonne, and of his faithfull ſeruants? And may not ſimple people thinke, when they ſee Chriſtes armes cast downe, and the Princes ſet vp in their place, that there dwell men, who make more account of their Princes honour, then they doe of Chriſtes? And that their meeting in that place (cal it what you wil) is rather to ſerue their Prince, then to ſerue Christ. But I haue beene longer in their place of prayer then I thought.</p>
            <p>I come nowe to the men that are elected to ſerue the Lord there. Be not many of them (for the whole corps I will not touch) ſuch as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was glad to chooſe, when he made a Schiſme in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> to wit, <hi>de extremis populi, qui non erant de filijs Leui:</hi> not lawfull ſucceſſors of the true <hi>Prieſtes,</hi> but others of the baſer ſort of the people, and them commonly that are notable, either for ignorance or ſome other odde quality? and must they not alſo fill their good patrons handes with ſome feeling commodity, before they can gette a benefice? And ſo beginning with ſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, lincked with perjurie (for the poore fellowes muſt neuertheleſſe ſweare, that they come freely to their benefice) are they not like to proceede on holily? As for the vowe of chaſtity, the daylie ſeruice and often faſting, which <hi>Catholike Prieſts</hi> are bound vnto; they by the ſweet liberty of the newe Gospell, doe exchange into ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing themſelues with their yoke-fellowes: this of the common ſort of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. With their preachers I will not meddle for feare of offence: yet if any deſire to knowe howe they behaue themſelues in other countries, they may read the cenſure of a zealous learned preacher, one of their owne compagnions; who amongſt many other thinges writeth thus of them.<note place="margin">Menno l. de Chriſt fide. titul. de fide. mulieris Cananeae</note> 
               <hi>When you come to preachers, who bragge that they haue the word of God, you ſhall find certaine of them manifeſt liars, others drunkers, ſome vſurers and foule-mouthed ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, ſome perſecutors and betraiers of harmeleſſe perſons. Howe ſome of them behaue themſelues, and by what meanes they gette their wiues, and what kind of wiues they haue, that I leaue to the Lord and them. They liue an jdle, ſlouthfull and voluptuous life: by fraude and flattery they feed themſelues of the ſpoiles of</hi> Antichrist (he meaneth the benefices taken from the <hi>Papiſts) and doe preach juſt as the earthly and carnall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate deſireth to heare, and will permitte,</hi> &amp;c. So much, and not a litle more, ſpeaketh one great Maſter of the late reformation, concerning his Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bretheren. Are not theſe goodly lampes of the newe Gospell, and likely perſons to be choſen by Chriſt, to giue light to others, and to reforme the world? But perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23774:12"/> they haue in ſome ſecret corners, certaine deuout religious ſoules, who in an austere retired life, doe with continuall teares bewaile the ſinnes of the reſt, and make inceſſant ſute vnto the Almighty, for a generall pardon of the whole. Would to God they had, but I feare me that they be of their inuiſible congregation, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none ſuch to be found amongſt them. For thoſe religious houſes, which our Anceſters had built for ſuch Godly and vertuous people, who (forſaking both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mother, all their kinne and acquaintance, and flying from all the pleaſures and preferments, which this tranſitorie world could yeeld them) gaue themſelues wholy to the holy exerciſes of humility, chaſtity, pouerty, and all ſortes of mortification: theſe Monaſteries (I ſay) and all that profeſſed in them a retired religious life, the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> haue beaten downe and baniſhed, and haue not in their places erected any other, for the ſinguler Godly men or women of their religion; Which doth moſt euidently argue, that there is in them ſmale zeale, and rare practiſe, of any ſuch extraordinary piety and deuotion. Surely it muſt needes be a ſtrange Chriſtian congregation, that holdeth them for no tollerable members of their common weale, whome Chriſt ſpecially chooſeth to ſerue him day and night; and by whoſe holy example and moſt feruent prayers, all other Chriſtians doe find themſelues much edified, and mightily protected. So that briefly, whether you conſider the perſons that ſerue God; or the place where he is ſerued; or the manner of his diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, the <hi>Catholike</hi> religion doth in euery point ſurpaſſe the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> by many degrees. Thus much in anſwere vnto <hi>Maſter PERKINS</hi> objection of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> againſt vs, the which I eſteemed fitteſt for this Preface, being a matter of ſo great moment, and therefore moſt worthy to be examined and conſidered of a part, with mature judgement.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ITHERTO we agree in wordes, but in ſence nothing at all. For he frameth a ſtrange conſtruction of that real preſence: <hi>which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>muſt be conſidered two waies.</hi> Firſt, <hi>in reſpect of the ſignes;</hi> Secondly, <hi>in respect of the communicants: the ſignes be bread and wine, with which Chriſtes body and bloud be preſent, not in reſpect of place and coexiſtence, but by ſacramentall relation:</hi> that is, <hi>when the ſacramentall ſignes of bread and wine are preſent to the hand, they doe preſent to the minde of the receiuer, the body and bloud of Chriſt.</hi> So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready M. PERKINS <hi>vnfained, true reall preſence,</hi> is ſhrunken into a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall relation, and only ſignificatiue preſence; ſuch as may well be of thinges as farre diſtant the one from the other, as the cope of heauen is from the center of the earth: a ſtrange reall preſence ſurely. <hi>The ſecond kinde of preſence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in respect of the communicants, to whoſe belieuing hartes he is alſo really preſent.</hi> If you aſke whether this be not as odde a kinde of preſence as the other was? he anſwereth by going about the buſh: ſaying, <hi>that ſuch as the communion is, ſuch is the preſence: and by the communion you must judge of the preſence. Ignotum</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>per ignotius.</hi> He might ſhortly haue ſaid (if he had meant plaine dealing) that by your faith you muſt mount into heauen, and take hold on Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of his Father, and from thence drawe his righteouſneſſe, and conuey it to your ſelfe: ſo that both ſortes of his <hi>true reall preſence,</hi> is made vvithout any nearer meeting of the parties, then heauen and earth doe meete togither. But let vs giue him the hearing: <hi>this reall communion is made on this manner. God the Father giueth Christ in this Sacrament as really and truly, as any thing can be giuen to man, and that not peece-meale, but whole Christ; yet, not the ſubſtance of the God-head, but the efficacy, merits, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are conueyed thence to the man-hood: but the whole man-hood, both in reſpect
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23774:14"/> of ſubſtance, as of merits and benefits, is giuen wholy and jointly together. And when God ſo giueth Chriſt, he giueth withall at the ſame time the spirit of Christ: which createth in the hart of the receiuer the inſtrument of true faith, by which the hart doth really receiue Christ, by reſting vpon the promiſe which God hath made, that he will giue Christ and his righteouſneſſe vnto euery true beleeuer. Nowe then, when God giueth Christ and his benefits, and man by faith receiueth the ſame; there riſeth an vnion betweene them, not forged but reall, and ſo neare, that none can be nearer: and being a reall vnion, there is a reall communion, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a reall preſence of Christ to the hart of him that receiueth the Sacrament in faith. And thus farre</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe we conſent with the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may well be that you agree herein with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, that is; with ſome apiſh counterfeit of the <hi>Roman:</hi> but the true <hi>Roman</hi> Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all that phantaſtical kinde of receiuing, as you your ſelfe declare in the wordes following. But before we come vnto them, let vs note by the way ſome ſtrange points (of doctrine ſhall I ſay) or rather dreaming of our conceited Maſters the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Who euer yet heard in true diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that the God-head conſidered apart by it ſelfe, had merits to conuey to the man-hood, as M. PER. here teacheth? for merits belong to an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in reſpect of his ſuperior, of whome he meriteth: now the God-head is not inferior to any, as all but <hi>Arrians</hi> confeſſe. Againe, howe can whole Chriſt be giuen to man, as M. PER. firſt affirmeth, if the ſubſtance of the God-head be not giuen, as preſently after he declareth? for the ſubſtance of the God-head is the principal part of Chriſt, who is both God &amp; man. Moreouer, how is Chriſtes ſubſtance as well as his benefits, made ours; or really preſent to our faith, if vve be made partakers only of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which may (as euery man knoweth) well be, without any bodily preſence of his? beſides, that fiction of his, <hi>that faith is created in our hart, at the ſame inſtant that we receiue the Sacrament,</hi> is very abſurd. For (as all the world witneſſeth) a man muſt be indued vvith faith, before he goe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Sacrament; or elſe he preſenteth himſelfe moſt vnworthily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that holy table. Laſtly, if ſimple men &amp; ſilly women ſhould not receiue this Sacrament, vntill they vnderſtood M. PER. doctrine of <hi>ſacramentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, of his reall vnion and communion made by ſpeciall faith</hi> in it (as no man ſhould receiue, before he knoweth what and howe he is to receiue) then ſurely they ſhould neuer receiue it, the manner of it is ſo intricate, and ſo farre paſſing their capacity. I may not omit here, that which I clipped off in M. PER. diſcourſe, to make it the more perſpicuous: to wit, that <hi>Chriſtes benefits are beſtowed vpon ſome by Gods imputation only; vpon others they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by a kind of propagation,</hi> which M. PER. cannot expreſſe fitly, but doth reſemble it thus. <hi>As one candle is lighted by another, and ſo the light of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23774:14"/> one is conueied vnto twenty candles: euen ſo the inherent righteouſnes of euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer, is deriued from the ſtore-houſe of righteouſneſſe, which is the man-hood of Christ:</hi> this (I ſay) I could not but let the gentle reader vnderſtand, that he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider howe ſlippery &amp; vnconſtant the man is in his owne doctrine. In the queſtion of juſtification, it is high treaſon to confeſſe any <hi>inherent righteouſneſſe</hi> in vs.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 66.</note> For (as he there ſaith) <hi>it doth raſe the very foundation of religion:</hi> there only he alloweth of a certaine ſtrange reall imputation of Chriſtes juſtice vnto vs; but here (hauing belike forgotten that euer he ſaid any ſuch word) he teacheth beſides that <hi>imputatiue,</hi> an <hi>inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied from Chriſt into euery righteous mans ſoule. With whome will this man agree (trowe you) that cannot agree with himſelfe?</p>
               <p>Let vs nowe come vnto the maine point of our diſſent, which M. PER. deliuereth thus: <hi>we differ not touching the preſence it ſelfe, but only in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of preſence. For though we hold a reall preſence of Christes body and bloud in the Sacrament: yet, we doe not take it to be locall, bodily, or ſubſtantiall; but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and myſticall: firſt to the ſignes, by ſacramentall relation; then to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, by faith alone.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>maintaineth a locall, bodily, and ſubſtantiall preſence of Chriſtes body and bloud, by a change and conuerſion of the bread and wine into the ſaid body and bloud; which they beleeue to be wrought by the vertue of Chriſtes wordes, pronounced ouer the bread and wine by a lawfull</hi> Prieſt, <hi>intending to doe that, which Christ at his last ſupper inſtituted and commanded him to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Maſter PERKINS reaſons to the contrary be theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This corporall preſence ouerturneth ſundry articles of faith. For we beleeue that the body of Christ was made of the pure ſubſtance of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and that but once:</hi> namely, <hi>when it was conceiued by the holy Ghost. But this cannot ſtand, if the body of Chriſt be made of bread, vnleſſe we beleeue contraries: that the body was made of the Virgin, and not of the Virgin; made once, and not once, but often.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read not in our Creede, <hi>made of the Virgin Mary,</hi> but borne of her: nowe there is great difference betweene <hi>made</hi> and <hi>borne.</hi> For a houſe is made of a Carpenter; but is not borne of him: but the vvord <hi>made</hi> (vvhich may alſo in good ſence be vſed) being fitter to cloake the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Maſter PERKINS cared not to ſtraine a little curteſie vvith the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our beleefe, and to thruſt in <hi>made,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>borne.</hi> But let this prety jugling-tricke paſſe, and to his argument I anſwere, that the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this contrariety, proceedeth either out of meere ignorance of our doctrine, or elſe out of the equiuocation of this word <hi>made.</hi> For we hold, that Chriſtes bleſſed body is but once made, if <hi>made</hi> be taken for to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned and formed newe from the beginning: ſo was it but once made of the pure bloud of the immaculate Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but may be againe and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23774:15"/> againe well made preſent, vnder this or that forme, or on this or that altar: which hath no ſhadowe of contrariety with the other. For euery mans body vvhich is but once made in his mothers vvombe, may afterward a thouſand times be made preſent, in one or diuers places. Nowe when we ſay with the ancient Fathers, that <hi>of bread is made the body of Chriſt;</hi> the ſence is, that the ſubſtance of bread is turned into the body of Chriſt: ſo that then there is no more the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread vnder the formes of bread, but Chriſtes body which ſucceedeth in place of it; &amp; therefore the bread is ſaid to be turned vnto Chriſtes body, and Chriſtes body to be made of bread: not that any part of the bread remaineth changed into Chriſtes body, or that Chriſtes body is a newe created and framed; but becauſe that by that very action (wherewith the bread is remoued out the body is brought into that place) the one is ſaid to be made of the other; ſo that here is nothing contrary vnto that article of our beleefe: <hi>borne of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> Mary.</p>
               <p>No more is there vnto that other ſpecified by M. PERKINS: <hi>he aſcended into heauen; and from thence ſhall he come to judge, &amp;c:</hi> for albeit he aſcended the fortith day after his reſurrection, and ſhall at the laſt day come from thence to judgement: yet, betweene thoſe two daies he may be where he will; and whereſoeuer elſe he be, it hath no direct repugnance with either branch of that article: and therefore, it doth but bewray the inſufficiency of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſkill in the rules of oppoſition or repugnances; who ſo confidently auerre ſuch great contrariety to be, where there is none at all. <hi>But</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſaith,</hi>

               <p>Maſter PERKINS ſecond reaſon. <hi>This bodily preſence ouerturneth the nature of a true body, whoſe eſſentiall propriety it is, to haue length, breadth, and thickneſſe: and by reaſon of theſe three dimenſions, a body can occupy but one place at once, as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>ſaid, the propriety of a body is to be ſeated in ſome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23774:16"/> place: they therefore that ſay the body of Chriſt is in many places at once, doe make it no body at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> We graunt it to be the intrinſecall nature of a body, to haue length, breadth, and thickneſſe; ſo that no body can poſſibly be vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe dimenſions: but vve denie it to be eſſentiall vnto a body, to be ſeated in ſome place. For <hi>quantity</hi> and <hi>vbi,</hi> be two diſtinct predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the learned knowe; <hi>quantity</hi> being perfect in his owne nature, vvithout any relation to the place: for <hi>quantity</hi> hath an abſolute and no reſpectiue eſſence. True it is, that a body is by nature fit and apt to be ſeated in a place, vvhich is that that <hi>Aristole</hi> teacheth of it. As a man naturally is apt to bee learned; yet, actually to bee learned, is a meere accident to man, and manie men be vvithout it: euen ſo to be actually ſeated in a place, is altogither vvithout the nature of a body; in ſo much as the greateſt body of all others (to vvit) the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is vvithout a place, there being no body vvithout it, vvhoſe extremity may enuiron and compaſſe in that heauen being the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt body, as the nature of a place requireth: ſo that it belongeth not to the eſſence and nature of a body, actually to be in any place; and conſequently, vvhether it be in a place, or not in any place; vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in one place or in many places, the body remayneth ſtill a true perfect body, accompliſhed vvith all his ſubſtantiall partes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, our faith teacheth vs, that the naturall ſubſiſtence and perſon of a man (vvhich is much nearer to the nature of man, then his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a place) can be ſeparated from man leauing his vvhole nature entire and perfect, as it is in Chriſt our Sauiour; vvhere the full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete nature of man, is vvithout his owne naturall ſubſiſtence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it being ingrafted and taken into the perſon of GOD. Hovve much more eaſily then, may his bleſſed body be vvithout occupying any place, vvhich is farre more extrinſecall to him? And touching the taking vp of as great a place, as the biggeneſſe of the body requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, vve hold vpon the ſame groundes: that it is of no ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that the power of God can diſpence vvith it. For if a body may be in no place at all, it may be in as little a roome as it ſhall pleaſe God to encloſe it. VVhich our Sauiour alſo very plainely teacheth: vvhen he ſignifieth that <hi>it is poſsible to God,</hi>

                  <hi>for to paſſe a Camell through the eye of a needle.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe entring into the houſe, vvhere his Diſciples vvere aſſembled, <hi>the doores being ſhutte;</hi> gaue vs a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt experiment, that a true naturall body needeth no ſpace at all to be ſeated in, but may (by diuine power) paſſe through other ſolide bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: ſo that it remaineth euident to them that haue ſkill in Philoſophie,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23774:17"/> that there is no ſuch repugnance in a true naturall body, but that it may be in many places at once; or in as litle a place as it ſhall pleaſe God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it. And when any of the ancient Fathers ſay, that bodies muſt needes haue places proportionable to them; they meane, that according vnto the ordinary courſe of nature, ſo it muſt be: yet they doe not denie, but that God can otherwiſe diſpoſe of them.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS third reaſon. <hi>Tranſubſtantion ouerthroweth the very ſupper of the Lord. For in euery Sacrament there muſt be a ſigne, a thing ſignified, and a proportion betweene them both.</hi> Good, let it be remembred: <hi>but the</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes <hi>reall preſence taketh all away. For when the bread is really turned into the body of Christ then the ſigne is aboliſhed, and there remaineth nothing but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formes of bread and wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Not ſo: for there is alſo the body and bloud of Chriſt as vve hold, and ſo at the moſt there is nothing gone but the ſigne only, as he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the bread: but neither is that taken away, and then all remaineth whole. For not the ſubſtance of bread and wine, but the outward formes of them, are the ſigne of the Sacrament. For they alone doe no leſſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto our minde and vnderſtanding, the ſpiritual feeding of our ſoules by Chriſtes body, then if they had the ſubſtance of bread vnder them: as the ſimilitude of <hi>fiery tongues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</note> without the true ſubſtance of tongues, did ſufficiently ſignifie the gift of tongues, beſtowed vpon the Apoſtles at the feaſt of <hi>Pentecost.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 3.</note> And it is not neceſſary to belieue, that <hi>the Doue</hi> which deſcended vpon our Sauiour at his baptiſme, was a true naturall Pigeon: but the outward ſhape of a <hi>Doue,</hi> was ſufficient to expreſſe thoſe Doue-like qualities vvhich were in our Sauiour: ſo the outward ſhewe of bread and wine, although the ſubſtance be abſent, ſerueth very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniently to make vs remember and vnderſtand, that euen then when we receiue the bleſſed Sacrament, our ſoules are as ſpiritually fedde vvith it, as our bodies are wont to be with bread and wine: or which is ſignified ſecondarylie, that as bread is made of many graines of corne, vnited and compact into one maſſe and body; euen ſo all vve Chriſtians by receiuing the Sacrament worthily, and by the ſpirit of Chriſt dwelling in vs, are made one miſticall body of Chriſt; and ſhould therefore one loue and tender the good of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as members of the ſame body are wont to doe: All this (I ſay) the outward forme and ſhewe of bread only, doth as vvell preſent vnto our mindes, as if the ſubſtance of bread were there preſent with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe</hi> (ſaith M. PER.) <hi>it aboliſheth the endes of the Sacrament. Firſt, it maketh we cannot remember Christ: who being preſent bodily in the Sacrament needeth not be remembred, becauſe helpes of remembrance are of thinges abſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A man would thinke (were not his wits ſomewhat diſtempered)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23774:17"/> that he might be remembred beſt, that is moſt preſent to vs: neither is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance only of things abſent. For as euery one may well remember, when they ſee one whome they haue ſeldome ſeene before; the very ſight of him, or his ſpeech, or ſome other token which he telleth, calleth vs to remembrance of him, who is perſonally then preſent. But if this were not ſo: yet, were the end of the Sacrament accompliſhed moſt perfectly. For by Chriſtes reall preſence in the Sacrament, we are admoniſhed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, not his body barely;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> but his death on the Croſſe (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it) which death of his is abſent: and by the conſecrating of his body apart from his bloud, and by the eleuation of it, is repreſented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs very liuely; and ſo we are put in minde and made to remember a thing abſent, to wit: the death and paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, M. PER. ſaith, <hi>that an other end of the Sacrament is, to feed the ſoule with eternall life: but by tranſubſtantiation the principall feeding is of the body, and not of the ſoule, which is only fed with ſpirituall foode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Alas, into what ſtraightes was he brought when he wrote this? a man would thinke, that if the ſubſtance of bread remained ſtill (as in their counterfeit Sacrament it doth) it ſhould rather be food for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then for the ſpirit. For bread (as fooles knowe as well as phiſitions) doth nouriſh the body naturally. We then that remoue the ſubſtance of bread out of the Sacrament, muſt needes therefore meane to feed only the ſoule thereby, and not the body at all. For Chriſtes bleſſed body receiued in the Sacrament, is nurriture only of our ſoule, by his graces bountifully beſtowed vpon the worthy receiuer; it giueth to the body only, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſeede or pledge of immortallity, according vnto that:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 54.</note> 
                  <hi>He that eateth my fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath life euerlasting, and I will raiſe him vp in the laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. PERKINS fourth reaſon. <hi>In the Sacrament the body of Chriſt is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as it was crucified, and his bloud as it was ſhed vpon the croſse, but nowe the act of crucifying is paſt; it is faith alone, that maketh Chriſt crucified to be preſent vnto vs in the Sacrament.</hi> ergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> We denie his firſt propoſition: for we receiue the ſame body that was crucified, but not after that bloudy manner, as it was there vſed; but vnder the formes of bread and wine, which Chriſtes owne vvordes doe importe: <hi>take eate, this is my body, that ſhall be giuen for you:</hi> he ſaith not (as M. PER. doth) <hi>as it ſhall be giuen for you;</hi> that is not in the ſame manner, though it be the ſame in ſubſtance. Yet (as I once ſaid before) the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of his bloud in the Chalice, as it were a part from his body, and powred out with the lifting vp of the body after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration (as it is done in the <hi>Maſſe</hi>) with the breaking and receiuing of the holy Hoſt, doth liuely repreſent vnto the faithfull, Chriſtes bleſſed death and paſſion. But what
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23774:18"/> reſemblance hath the eating of bread, &amp; drinking of wine (the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> holy communion) with the crucifying of Chriſt? Is eating and drinking of ſo pleaſing food, meete to expreſſe Chriſtes drinking of gall, and moſt painefull torments? by their feeling faith, they would ſalue this, but they cannot. For beſides faith, there muſt be (as M. PER. himſelfe before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) a proportion betweene the ſigne and the thing ſignified; but there is no proportion betweene eating of fine bread, &amp; drinking of good wine, with the dolorous croſſe of Chriſt. Seing then, that in the Sacrament (as M. PER. teacheth) Chriſtes body muſt be receiued, as it was crucified, he muſt needes appoint ſomething elſe then bread &amp; wine, to be the ſignes of this Sacrament: for they be moſt vnproper to repreſent Chriſtes paſſion.</p>
               <p>Againe (ſaith he, diſcourſing very learnedly) <hi>That bloud which ranne out of Chriſtes ſide was not gathered vp againe; nay, the collection of it was needleſſe, becauſe after the reſurrection, he liued no more a naturall, but a ſpirituall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is a proper peece of diuinity. He might aſwel ſay (if his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were good) that Chriſts body is not riſen againe, becauſe a body alſo, is as needles vnto a ſpiritual life. The truth is, that the body with the bloud in the veines of it, is riſen againe: elſe were it no true reſurrection, which is only when the very ſame body <hi>numero,</hi> with all the ſame parts and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of it, which it had before, be reſtored vnto their former eſſence &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. Note by the way, the admirable rare vertue of the <hi>Proteſtants faith, whoſe property is</hi> (ſaith M. P.) <hi>to giue a being vnto thinges, which are not.</hi> What being good Sir? that any thing ſhould be extant in the world, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not? yes marry, that that bloud ſhould be receiued ſpiritually, which is not at al. True (perhaps) in the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> vaine imagination: but (in deed) moſt ridiculous, to imagine that that can be receiued either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally or ſpiritually, vvhich is not extant, nor hath any being at all.

And <hi>the lawe had a ſhadowe of the thinges to come, not the very Image, as we haue;</hi> ſo that nothing could be further from the Apoſtles meaning, then to make the <hi>Iewes</hi> equall in Sacraments and graces, with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who were Chriſtians. But his intention was (as may be eaſily ſeene by that vvhich goeth before and followeth) to warne the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to chaſtice their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as he himſelfe did (as he ſaith in the end of the Chapter going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and to flie from all vice; and not to rely only vpon the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gifts of God beſtowed vpon them. For (ſaith he) the ancient <hi>Iſraelites</hi> all, were partakers of many ſinguler fauours of God: <hi>as of the eating of</hi> Manna, <hi>of drinking of the</hi> Rocke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet, becauſe many of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication and liued wickedly, God was not pleaſed vvith all of them. Obſerue alſo that not one thing there mentioned by the Apoſtle was a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t among the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and therefore are they vnſkilfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with our Sacraments. For a Sacrament is a ſet ceremony, to be vſed ordinarily in the vvorſhip of God: but their paſſing through the red Sea was but once, therefore no ſet ceremony: their eating of <hi>Manna,</hi> and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>Rocke,</hi> were but naturall refections to them; yea, their cattle did drinke of the <hi>Rocke</hi> aſwell as their Maſters: vvhich thinges, though they did prefigure our Sacraments; yet, were no Sacraments at all, and much leſſe any thing in vertue comparable to our Sacraments.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS ſixt reaſon. <hi>The Sabbaoth was made for man, and not man for the Sabbaoth: ſo it may be ſaid, that the Sacrament was made for man, and not man for the Sacrament; and therefore man is more excellent then the Sacrament, the end being alwaies better then the thing ordained to the end: but if Chriſtes body be really in the Sacrament, then is not man more excellent then it.</hi> ergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the like argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you may as wel proue, that the Sonne of God is not, nor euer ſhal be incarnate for the redemption of man: or els (which is moſt abſurd) that man is better then God, <hi>becauſe for vs men, &amp; for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, Chriſt deſcended from heauen, &amp; was borne of the V.</hi> Mary. <hi>The end</hi> then, <hi>being alwaies better then the thing ordained to the end</hi> (as M. P. argueth) either Chriſt is not yet borne to redeme man; or els man is better then Chriſt. See what goodly arguments they vſe, to deceiue the ſimple withal! the direct anſwere is, that the maine &amp; principall end of Chriſts incarnation, paſſion,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23774:19"/> and reall preſence in the Sacrament, is the glory of Gods juſtice, wiſdome, and goodneſſe, and of his owne mercy and bounty, which are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then Chriſtes incarnation and reall preſence: mans redemption, ſpirituall feeding and ſaluation, are but ſecondary endes, which are farre inferior vnto our moſt louing redeemers mercy, kindneſſe, and charity, through which he hath procured it.</p>
               <p>M. PER. confirmeth this reaſon with that which is nothing like it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Euer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For howe can God, or whole Chriſt be receiued, without the God-head) <hi>but by carnall eating we receiue not wholy Chriſt, but only a part of the man-hood: and therefore in the Sacrament there is no carnall eating, nor reall preſence.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We <hi>Catholikes</hi> doe eate al Chriſtes body wholy. For we part not his body, but beleeue that it is whole in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated Hoſt. Moreouer, becauſe his bleſſed body is a perfect liuing body, vve knowe alſo that it hath bloud in it, as other bodies haue; and is (yet further) joyned vvith his moſt holy ſoule: and ſo in receiuing his body, we receiue all his man-hood both body &amp; ſoule. Ouer and beſides, his God-head being lincked and joyned inſeperably with his man-hood; whole Chriſt both God and man is alwaies receiued together; ſo that euery lay <hi>Catholike</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but vnder one kind, doth receiue Chriſts body &amp; bloud: yea wholy, both all his man-hood and God-head: whereas, in the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> naturall communion of bread and wine, there is (in deed) neither body nor bloud, not any peece of Chriſt, but only in their owne phantaſticall imagination; ſo that thoſe their ordinary out-cries are moſt fond: <hi>The</hi> Papiſtes <hi>robbe you of the bloud, being one part of the Sacrament:</hi> Whereas <hi>Catholike</hi> Paſtors giue to their flocke vnder one kinde, both the body and bloud; yea, the very ſoule and God-head of Chriſt, as you haue heard. But the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes</hi> are the great Theeues in deede, vvho defraude their vnhappy followers of both body and bloud, and giue them only ſacramental ſignes and relations, to feede their fooliſh phantaſies.</p>
               <p>Before I come vnto M.

               </p>
               <p>We ſay contrarily, that it could be as well before, as after. When he goeth about to proue his poſition, he ſhall be anſwered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That Chriſt was the Miniſter of this Sacrament, and therefore if he had conuerted bread into his body, he ſhould haue taken his owne body into his handes:</hi> vvhich we graunt, following <hi>S. Augustine</hi> vpon theſe vvordes:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23774:19"/> 
                  <hi>He was caried in his owne handes.</hi>

                  <hi>Howe this may be vnderſtood</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of</hi> Dauid <hi>literally, we finde not; but we finde it in Christ: for Christ was carried in his owne handes, when deliuering his owne body, he ſaid: this is my body. For then he carried that his body in his owne handes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. PER. addeth yet further, <hi>that it ſhould alſo followe that Christ did eate his owne fleſh: for he did communicate alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to conſecrate his laſt ſupper in his owne perſon.</hi> This may be true, though it haue no warrant in the word. For <hi>S. Hierome</hi> a holy and moſt learned Doctor, doth affirme it, ſaying:<note place="margin">Epiſtol. ad Hedibian quaeſt. <hi>2.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly he auoucheth, <hi>that if we eate Chriſtes body really, we muſt needes be man-ſlayers:</hi> but he forgotte to proue it, <hi>dixit &amp; abijt.</hi> If other proofe fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, he might haue fledde vnto the ruſty opinion of the old farne <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaites,</hi> which is mentioned in the Goſpell it ſelfe. For they (as <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> expoundeth it) thought that Chriſt would cut his fleſh in peeces, as butchers doe beefe in the ſhambles, and either rawe or roſted, haue giuen it to be eaten; to ſome a legge, to other an arme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we <hi>Catholikes</hi> doe eate Chriſtes body whole, and that without any detriment or diminution vnto that bleſſed body, which is not extended vnder the partes of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hoſt, ſo as one part of his body is vnder one part of it, and another part vnder another: but is after the manner of our ſoule in the body, the whole body vnder the whole Hoſt, and the whole vnder euery part of the Hoſt; and ſo without any parting or deuiding of his body, it is wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of euery communicant, and remaineth after whole in their bodies, imparting his grace to their ſoules, ſo long as the formes of bread tary in their ſtomackes in their proper ſhapes, and afterward ceaſſeth to be there any longer: which is confirmed by thoſe diuine wordes of the glorious Apoſtle <hi>S.

                  </gap>o the real preſence, whether our bodies be nouriſhed by the accidents there preſent or no: neither is it ſo cleare a caſe in Philoſophy, whether odours
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23774:20"/> (that are naked quallities) doe nouriſh or no? as they, who haue ſtudied Philoſophie knowe. And laſtly, all matters of faith are aboue the rules of Philoſophie: vvherefore the reall preſence of Chriſts bleſſed body in the Sacrament, being a memoriall and monument of all his merueilous works; it muſt not be thought ſtrange, if there followe of it, many thinges aboue the reach of naturall Philoſophie: and yet not ſo many (perhaps) as muſt needes be granted by them, as well as by vs; in the <hi>reſurrection of our bodies;</hi> vvhich (notwithſtanding thoſe difficulties in Philoſophy) all Chriſtian men doe firmely beleeue.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs come vnto ſuch authorities as M.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dialog. </seg>1</label> Sacrament in all antiquity. <hi>Theodorete</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſame Christ, who called his naturall body foode and bread, who alſo called himſelfe a vine; he vouchſafed the viſible ſignes, the name of his owne body: not changing nature, but putting grace to nature.</hi> Here are ſcarce two wordes together; as it is in the author. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of his wordes be: <hi>Our Sauiour changed names, giuing to his body, the name of the ſigne; and to the ſigne, the name of his body,</hi> that is: he called his body bread, and bread his body; ſo that here is as much for vs, as againſt vs: and the latter part of the ſentence is wholy for vs. <hi>For Christ would</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haue them that he partakers of the miſteries, not to attend vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thinges which are ſeene (that is bread and wine) but by reaſon of the changing of names, to giue credit to that change, which is made by grace,</hi> that is: they hearing in conſecration that which was before bread and wine, to be then called his body and bloud, ſhould beleeue that then alſo bread and vvine, vvere changed and made his body and bloud; that change being wrought by the vertue and grace of his word. To theſe wordes of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorete</hi> in his firſt <hi>Dialogue,</hi> he joyneth other wordes of his taken out of his ſecond, yet quoting the ſame <hi>Dialogue. The myſticall ſignes after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leeſe not their nature: for they remaine in their firſt nature, figure and forme, and may be feine and touched as before.</hi> Here M. PER. ſhould haue ſtopped in the middeſt of the ſentence, as they are ſometimes accuſtomed to doe, and then had he left ſome ſhewe of wordes for his part; yet, ſuch as might eaſily be anſwered: but vvhen the reaſon of the remaining of myſticall ſignes in their former nature and figure, is (as he himſelfe declareth) that they may be ſeene as before; he doth giue the learned reader to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he ſpeaketh not of the inward ſubſtance of them, but of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23774:20"/> outward appearance, which is the proper object of the ſences: which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accidence, hath a certaine kind of eſſence and nature, as well as the ſubſtance it ſelfe. But that which followeth in <hi>Theodorete</hi> putteth al out of doubt. For he addeth: <hi>The myſticall ſignes may be ſeene as before: but that which they are made, is vnderſtood.</hi> And what is it vnderſtood to be made? Marry, <hi>euen that which we beleeue and adore:</hi> which can be no other thing, but the true reall body, of Chriſt <hi>Ieſus</hi> God and man. For in him doe vve beleeue, and him doe we adore. See then, howe this his firſt and beſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, diſproueth plainely his owne poſition. M.

                  </note> where he ſheweth either ouer great boldnes, if he did not ſee the place, on exceeding wilfull malice, if he read it. For that ancient writer (out of that ceremony of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning al that was left of the Paſcal lambe) doth gather the cleane contrary, to wit: that if we cannot vnderſtand howe theſe thinges vvhich we ſee are turned into our Lordes body <hi>(Into which myſtery the Angels</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with their cleare ſight cannot pearce) then must we cast into the fire of the holy Ghost, theſe thinges; perſwading our ſelues, that to be poſsible vnto the vertue of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, which ſeemeth to vs impoſsible:</hi> See vvhat fire that vvorthy authour ſpeaketh of. And in the ſixt booke and two and twenty Chapter of the ſame vvorke, he ſpeaketh yet more plainely, ſaying: <hi>That he receiueth ignorantly, who knoweth not the vertue and dignity of this Sacrament, and who is ignorant that it is the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt in truth;</hi> ſo that old <hi>Heſichius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them of ignorance for not beeleuing Chriſtes body to be truly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23774:21"/> in the Sacrament. Secondly (ſaith M. PERK.) <hi>by the ſacramental vnion of the bread &amp; wine, with the body and bloud of Chriſt, they vſed to confirme the perſonall vnion of the man-hood of Chriſt with the God-head, againſt heretikes.</hi> Let vs admit this to be true: for then it followeth neceſſarily againſt himſelfe, that the true body of Chriſt, is really preſent in the bleſſed Sacrament, as his true <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dialog. </seg>2</label> God-head and man-hood, were really vnited in one perſon. But if <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> (whome he quoteth) be well read, you ſhall finde, that they againſt whome he writeth, objected this common doctrine of the Church <hi>(that bread is turned into the body of Chriſt)</hi> to proue, that the man-hood of Chriſt was turned into the God-head; and conſequently, that there were not two natures in Chriſt, but one. And albeit the conſequent was <hi>Hereticall;</hi> yet the antecedent was <hi>Catholike,</hi> good, and not denyed of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> but that there was a reall conuerſion of bread into the true body of Chriſt: and therefore did other <hi>Heretikes</hi> (who denied our Sauiour to haue true fleſh) deny alſo conſequently, the truth of the bleſſed Sacrament, as the ſame <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Not ſo: for he ſo reporteth it, that any man may ſee, that he beleeued it to be the very body of Chriſt. For firſt he ſaith, that thoſe children were pure and incorrupt, not falne from their ſtate of innocencie. Secondly, that they were faſting. Thirdly, he affirmeth in plaine tearmes, <hi>that they receiued the immaculate body of</hi> IESVS <hi>Chriſt God and Man.</hi> Finally, he proueth it ſo to be, and that by miracle. For one of the children who had receiued that morning, being by his father a malitious <hi>Iewe,</hi> afterwardes caſt into a glaſiers furnace moſt fiery hot, and ſhut in there for three daies ſpace was miraculouſly preſerued aliue, and found there without any hurt at all, by vertue of the bleſſed Sacrament which he had receiued. What ſtrange blindnes then was this, to alleadge this againſt the reall preſence, which ſo admirably doth confirme it? We knowe that in certaine places, ſome vſed to giue the bleſſed Sacrament vnto children: yea, vnto ſucking babes, being alſo dipped in the chalice; which rather proueth our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For they thought it neceſſary for all that would be ſaued, to receiue this holy Sacrament. Nowe theſe infants, could haue no ſuch act of faith (as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doctrine requireth) to make their communion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23774:21"/> at that time they held the ſame kinde of reall preſence which we doe; which is made by lawfull conſecration of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and not by the faith of the receiuer. And that you may perceiue, that I ſpeake not only by gheſſe, take the profeſſion of one of thoſe authors whome M.

                  <hi>Here we beleeue the nature of pure bread and wine</hi> (mixed with water) <hi>to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a nature indued with reaſon,</hi> to wit: <hi>into the nature of the body and bloud of Christ:</hi> can any thing be more plaine againſt them? Finally, M. PER. collecteth out of one <hi>Nicholas Cabaſilas,</hi> his expoſition of theſe wordes of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> Surſum corda, <hi>lift vp your harts: that (the people being willed by the</hi> Prieſt <hi>to lift vp their thoughts from the earth, and to thinke on thinges aboue) Christ is not really preſent with them; but only on the right hand of his Father.</hi> To which we anſwere, that when thoſe wordes were ſpoken, Chriſtes body (in deed) is not there really preſent, for they are in the preface before the Canon and conſecration: but is made preſent afterwardes, by the wordes of conſecration. Secondly, that he might (notwithſtanding thoſe wordes were ſpoken after the conſecration, as they be before) be there preſent. For being admoniſhed to call our mindes and harts from earthly thinges, and to lift them vp to conſider heauenly: what more diuine and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject can we meditate vpon, then our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the holy miſteries of his incarnation and paſſion there repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the infinite mercies and goodneſſe of God, powred out on vs through him, and by meanes of this holy Sacrifice? and thus much in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, doth the anſwere vnto thoſe wordes ſignifie <hi>(We lift vp our harts vnto our Lord)</hi> to attend vpon him at this time ſpecially, in theſe his holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.

                  <hi>The bread which I will giue, is my fleſh, which I will giue for the life of the world.</hi> Here is a plaine promiſe made by Chriſt <hi>Ieſus</hi> (that faileth not of his word) of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs his fleſh to eate, and that very fleſh which on the Croſſe was to be giuen for the redemption of the vvorld: theſe vvordes be ſo euident, that they who heard them, made no doubt of the ſence of them; but were aſtoniſhed at it, and ſaid: <hi>Howe can this man giue vs his fleſh to eate?</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:23774:22"/> they doubted not but that Chriſt had ſaid, that he vvould giue them his fleſh to eate, his ſpeaches were ſo plaine for it; but yet beleeued they not, that he could doe it. Nowe what replyed Chriſt vnto their doubt? that he vvould giue them only bread to eate in remembrance of him? vvhich vvould ſurely haue ſatisfied them throughly, becauſe nothing vvas more eaſie to doe then that. But truth is not to be concealed, for feare of Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall ſcandall: and therefore he told them very roundly, <hi>That vnleſſe they did eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud. They ſhould not haue life in them. And he that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, hath life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> And yet more expreſly: <hi>My fleſh is meate in deede, and my bloud drinke in deede.</hi> Howe ſhould he haue made the matter more plaine?</p>
               <p>To this M. PERKINS anſwereth, firſt; <hi>That Christ ſpeaketh of a ſpirituall eating by faith:</hi> becauſe the very point that he intendeth to proue, is; <hi>that to beleeue in him, and to eate his fleſh, is all one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwere is abſurd: For euen in their owne doctrine, there is a great difference betweene beleeuing in Chriſt, and receiuing the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for many doe beleeue in Chriſt when they doe not receiue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: receiuing <hi>being</hi> (as they teach) <hi>a ſeale or confirmation of beleeuing.</hi> And to ſay, that Chriſt there maketh no difference betweene beleeuing in him, and <hi>eating of his fleſh,</hi> is flat againſt the text. For ſaying that he would hereafter giue them his fleſh to eate, he doth declare, that he ſpeaketh not of beleeuing in him, vvhich he vvould haue them to doe preſently; and many of them did beleeue in him before, vvho could not diſgeſt his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is altogether vnlikely, that our Sauiour would haue vſed ſuch ſtrange offenſiue ſpeaches (as the <hi>eating of his fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drinking of his bloud</hi>) to ſignifie only, that they muſt beleeue in him: and that he ſeing them ſo much ſcandalized at thoſe his hard and vnvſuall phraſes, that they vvere ready to forſake him; would yet, not once in plaine tearmes interprete them, for the ſauing of ſo many ſoules: wherefore, it remaineth moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that by <hi>eating of his fleſh,</hi> he meant ſomething elſe, then beleeuing in him. And M. PER. other ſhift, that in all the ſixt Chapter of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaketh not one word of eating his fleſh in the Sacrament, is ſo contrary vnto the euidence of the text it ſelfe, and vnto the expoſition of all ancient Fathers, that it deſerueth no anſwere; eſpecially, vvhen neither by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or authority, he goeth about to fortifie it. But I muſe why he did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, their ordinary objection out of the ſame place: <hi>The fleſh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is the spirit that quickneth.</hi> It may be (perhaps) becauſe he knewe that the vvordes being rightly vnderſtood, make more againſt the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> then for them. For <hi>the fleſh</hi> there, muſt be taken either for Chriſtes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23774:22"/> fleſh, or for our fleſh: if for Chriſtes fleſh,<note place="margin">Tract. <hi>27.</hi> in Ioanne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> then (ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtine) Howe can it be, that it profiteth nothing? when he ſaid before:</hi> vnleſſe yo eate my fleſh, you ſhall haue no life in you. <hi>What therefore meaneth this,</hi> it profiteth nothing? Marry (ſaith he) <hi>it profiteth nothing as they vnderſtood it. For they tooke they ſhould eate it, as it is torne and cut in peeces, being dead and ſold in the ſhambles; and not as it is quickned with the ſpirit,</hi> which he doth illuſtrate with the compariſon of knowledge, which being alone, doth puffe vp <hi>(ſcientia enim inflat)</hi> but being joyned with charity, doth edifie. Euen ſo (ſaith he) <hi>when the spirit is coupled with the fleſh, then doth it profit verie much, or elſe the worde would not haue beene made fleſh, and haue dwelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs.</hi> With <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> agreeth <hi>S. Cyril</hi> vpon that place;<note place="margin">In cap. <hi>6.</hi> Ioannis.</note> but more literall ſeemeth to be the interpretation of <hi>S. Chriſostome,</hi> followed by <hi>Theophilact</hi> and others, vpon this place: that by <hi>the fleſh,</hi> is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our fleſhly and naturall reaſon, which in theſe miſteries of faith, doth rather hinder then helpe vs. For mans wit of it ſelfe, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend howe bread may be turned into Chriſtes body; not howe ſo great a bodie can be in ſo litle a roome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but informed with faith and Gods grace, it is then well aſſured, that whatſoeuer Chriſt ſaith is true, and that nothing is impoſſible to him, howe contrarie ſoeuer it ſeeme vnto fleſh and bloud. For, <hi>his wordes</hi> (as it followeth in the text) <hi>be spirit and life,</hi> that is: be of diuine force, and giue life and being vnto vvhat hee pleaſeth. And thus much of our firſt reaſon: Nowe to the ſecond.</p>

                  <hi>this is my body which is giuen for you: and giuing them the Chalice, ſaid: drinke yee all of this, for this is my bloud of the newe Teſtament, which ſhall be ſhed for you.</hi> Theſe our Sauiours wordes are ſo plaine, that it was not poſſible in ſo fewe wordes to expreſſe more perſpicuouſly, that it was his true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodie, which he deliuered vnto them; it being the verie ſame which was to be nailed on the Croſſe the morrowe after.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This is a very extrauagant expoſition of Chriſtes vvordes, and ſuch a one, as if it vvere admitted for currant, vvoulde ſerue to ſubuert and ouerthrovve, all the articles of the Chriſtian faith. For example, vvhen it is ſaid, that <hi>the word was made fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Manachees</hi> hereſies againſt Chriſtes true fleſh, might be maintayned, by ſaying, that the fleſh there, is put for a figure of the fleſh: ſo might the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie, if vvhen Chriſt is called God, it vvere allowed them, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and take it, for a ſigne or ſeale of GOD; and ſo of all other
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23774:23"/> articles of our beleefe: wherefore, there muſt be moſt apparant proof, for the drawing of Chriſtes wordes into ſo ſtrange a ſence, before it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any reaſonable man. But M.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be, that ſometimes ſpeaking of Sacraments by the way, ſome figuratiue ſpeach may be vſed: but we ſay, that when any Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is firſt inſtituted and ordained, that then the wordes are to be taken lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, without any ſuch figure. For example, in the Sacraments (ſpecified by M. PER.) Circumciſion was commanded in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>You ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your prepuce, that it may be a ſigne of the couenant betweene you and me.</hi> Theſe be the wordes of the inſtitution of that Sacrament, and not one of them but muſt be literally taken. For the true fleſh in deede, was to be circumciſed and cut off, and no figure of the fleſh or ſigne of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, would ſerue the turne. In like manner, where the Sacrament of the Paſcall <hi>lambe</hi> is inſtituted,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</note> all muſt be vnderſtood literally, as a naturall lambe really killed, roſted and eaten: and not a figure, ſigne, or ſeale of it: euen ſo our bleſſed Sauiour inſtituting a Sacrament in theſe wordes, <hi>This is my body:</hi> the wordes muſt be taken literally, and not figuratiuely; and conſequently, the reaſon which M. PER. bringeth for him, beareth ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt himſelfe, becauſe it is and euer hath beene Gods faſhion, when he inſtituteth Sacraments, to inſtitute them in their proper tearmes, which muſt be taken literally, as by his owne examples hath bin proued: Nowe to his ſentences. <hi>Circumciſion is both a couenant, and the ſigne of a couenant, and that properly;</hi> although not of the ſame couenant. For it was a couenant tendred by God vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by him accorded vnto, to circumciſe himſelfe and all his ſeede of the male-kinde: and the very ſame couenant was alſo a <hi>ſigne</hi> &amp; <hi>badge</hi> of Gods peculier fauour vnto them, and their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall obligation to ſerue him; and a <hi>marke</hi> in them, of the choſen people of God: ſo that that ſpeach <hi>(circumciſion is the couenant)</hi> is not figuratiue, but literall. Neither is the <hi>lambe</hi> called the Angels paſſing by or ouer, in the place cited by M. P.; but rather the <hi>Iewes</hi> eating of it haſtily: and walking, was a ſigne of the Angels ſpeedy paſſing by them. The <hi>lambe</hi> is ſometimes called the <hi>paſſe-ouer:</hi> not becauſe it was the ſigne of it, but for that it vvas
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23774:23"/> the ſacrifice, celebrated in remembrance of it: ſo Chriſt is called our <hi>paſſe-ouer</hi> or Paſchall <hi>lambe;</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>lambe</hi> of God, ſacrificed to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſinnes of the vvorld: ſo that not in one of theſe ſentences, is the thing ſignified put for the <hi>ſigne,</hi> but rather the contrary. And when <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the</hi> Rocke <hi>was Chriſt:</hi> it is to be vnderſtood properly, becauſe he ſpeaketh of the ſpirituall <hi>Rocke,</hi> ſaying: <hi>And they did drinke all of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> Rocke, <hi>which was Christ properly.</hi> The materiall rocke, out of which the ſtreames of water guſhed, did (in deed) prefigure Chriſt on the croſſe, out of whoſe ſide iſſued bloud and water: but the <hi>ſpirituall Rocke</hi> (that is) the <hi>Rocke</hi> figured by that materiall, was really Chriſt himſelfe: ſo that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he hath not brought vs one place, where the name of the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is giuen to the ſigne: but ſuppoſe he could bring any, would it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon followe, that this place of the inſtitution of the Sacrament, muſt be expounded by the ſame figure? howe abſurd and ridiculous is this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reaſoning? <hi>In one or two places of Scripture the name of the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is giuen to the ſigne.</hi> ergo. In vvhat place ſoeuer it pleaſeth the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> it ſhall be ſo taken; albeit, in a thouſand other places, it muſt needes be taken otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But M. PERKINS ſaith ſecondly, <hi>That the</hi> Papiſts <hi>themſelues confeſſe, the like figuratiue phraſe to be in the inſtitution of the cup, when it is ſaid,</hi> This cup is the newe Teſtament in my bloud: <hi>that is</hi> (as M. PER. interpreteth it) <hi>a ſigne, ſeale, and pleadge of the newe Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſay that the inſtitution of that part of the Sacrament, is as plainely deliuered by <hi>S. Mathewe</hi> and <hi>S. Marke,</hi> as the other. For they haue in expreſſe vvordes: <hi>This is my bloud of the newe Teſtament:</hi> vvhich plaine and cleare ſpeach doth ſufficiently declare, howe <hi>S. Lukes</hi> more intricate and obſcure wordes, are to be vnderſtood; it being great reaſon, that that which is plaine &amp; eaſie to vnderſtand, ſhould interpret that which is hard; and not that which is obſcure, to be made an expoſition of that vvhich is lightſome &amp; cleare, as our wranglers (who loue darkenes more then light) would perſwade vs. For the better vnderſtanding of <hi>S. Lukes</hi> wordes you muſt obſerue, that a Teſtament is taken in two ſortes: either for the vvill and ordinance of the Teſtator; or elſe for the written inſtrument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the will is knowne and performed. Nowe this holy Sacrament, may truly be called a teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in both ſences. For it is both a ſpecial ordinance, to be obſerued and practiſed by Chriſtes will and inſtitution, during the whole ſtate of the newe Teſtament: and therefore truly called by <hi>S. Luke. The newe Teſtament,</hi> being a principall part of it. Ouer and beſides, it is a ſinguler meanes and inſtrument, a more effectuall then a vvritten vvill, to conuey and deriue vnto vs, our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt <hi>Ieſus</hi> legacy,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23774:24"/> by the worthy receiuing of it, that is: his grace in this world, and glory in the next; and for this cauſe it is ſaid of <hi>S. Mathewe,</hi> to be <hi>the bloud of the newe Teſtament;</hi> and not the ſeale or ſigne of it. And thus finally, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reader may ſee, that M. PER. can ſhew no ſufficient cauſe, why Chriſtes wordes ſhould be expounded by ſuch a ſtrange figure: whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth euidently, that they are to be taken according vnto their natiue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſence. For ſo muſt all holy Scripture be vnderſtood, vnleſſe there be apparant reaſon to the contrary. Notwithſtanding, becauſe this matter is of very great moment, as being one of the higheſt miſteries of our faith, I will inſiſt and ſtand ſomewhat, vpon the circumſtances of it. Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all the places together, vvhere the inſtitution is rehearſed, and you ſhall finde in them all,<note place="margin">

Iohn</hi> addeth: <hi>That Christ knowing that his houre was come, that he ſhould paſſe out of this world to his Father; whereas he loued his that were in the world, vnto the end he loued them: and when ſupper was done,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Father had giuen him all thinges into his handes, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;</hi> and ſo forth: This Preface (I ſay) being made before the inſtitution of the Sacrament, ſheweth that Chriſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently longed to come to it, and intended to leaue vnto his louing Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples nowe at his laſt fare-well, a monument and token of his diuine power and loue towardes them. If after all this, he ſhould haue left nothing vnto them, but an order of eating a morſell of bread, and drinking a ſuppe of vvine, in remembrance of his death; there had beene no congruity in it. For many much meaner men then he, had left far greater remembrances, and pleadges of their loue behinde them. Wherefore the wordes muſt be taken as they ſound; and then, no creature euer left, or could poſſibly leaue, the like token and pleadge of his power and loue to his friendes, as his owne body and bloud, to be the diuine comfort and foode of their ſoules. And this doth that moſt eloquent Father <hi>S. Iohn Chriſostome,</hi> both note and dilate,<note place="margin">Homil. <hi>83</hi> in Math.</note> ſaying: <hi>Louers when they depart from them, whome they loue, are wont to leaue with them (for a remembrance of their harty affection) ſome ſuch jewell or gift as they are able: but no other creature ſauing Christ, could leaue his owne proper fleſh.</hi>

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:23774:24"/>
               <p>An other motiue to perſwade, that Chriſtes vvordes are to be taken literally, is gathered of this, that they be a part of Chriſtes Teſtament, and containe a legacy bequeathed vnto vs Chriſtians; vvhich kinde of vvordes are alwaies to be interpreted, according to their proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And it ſhould be the moſt fooliſh part in the vvorld, vvhen a father doth by his laſt vvill, bequeath vnto one of his ſonnes a farme, or any certaine portion of good, to pleade that the vvordes vvere to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded figuratiuely, and that he meant only to leaue his ſonne a figure of a farme, or ſome ſigne of a portion; vvhich yet the <hi>Protestants</hi> doe pleade in this moſt diuine teſtament of our Sauiour Chriſt <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Thirdly, you haue heard before alſo, howe that in the inſtitution of all Sacraments, the ſpeaches are to be taken literally; and much more in this, vvhich is the very marrowe of Chriſtian religion, and vvherein errour is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: therefore, moſt requiſite it was to haue beene deliuered in ſuch tearmes, as vvere to be vnderſtood literally. Laſtly, albeit Chriſt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſpake vnto the multitude in parables and obſcurely, becauſe of their incredulity: yet, vnto his Diſciples (vvhome he vvould haue to vnderſtand him) he commonly ſpake plainely; or elſe; vvas accuſtomed to interpret vnto them his harder ſpeaches; according to that:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>To you it is giuen to knowe the mysteries of the Kingdome of heauen, to them it is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and therefore in parables ſpeake I to them.</hi> But Chriſt here giueth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretation, then that it was the ſame, <hi>His body, which ſhould be nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Croſſe:</hi> neither did the Diſciples aſke after any expoſition of them; vvhich is a plaine ſigne, that they tooke them literally, the holy Ghoſt putting them in minde of that, which Chriſt had taught them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of this admirable Sacrament, in the ſixt of <hi>S.</hi> Iohn: <hi>That he would giue them his fleſh to eate;</hi> and <hi>that his fleſh was truly meate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I haue proſecuted two reaſons for the reall preſence: one out of the promiſe of it; the other out of the performance, and inſtitution of it: vvhich are all that it pleaſed M. PERKINS to produce in our fauour, though he had multiplied reaſons for his owne party, and enlarged them very amply; but hath as cuttedly propoſed ours, &amp; loded them alſo with very many replies: wherefore, ſomewhat to ſupply his default herein, I will adde foure more for vs: that for a doozen of his, we may be alowed to haue halfe a doozen. The firſt of them which is the third in order, ſhall be gathered from the figure of this Sacrament thus. <hi>The figure or ſhadowe of any thing, is alwaies inferior vnto the thing it ſelfe</hi> (as the Image of a man is not to be compared to the man himſelfe, nor the ſhadowe to the body) <hi>but if in the Sacrament there be but bread, ſignifying the body of Christ, then ſhould the figure of it be more excellent then it ſelfe: wherefore, to auoide that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23774:25"/> inconuenience it muſt needs be granted, that the body of Chriſt is there really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> which farre ſurpaſſeth all the figures of it. The minor propoſition is to be proued: Firſt, to omitte all other figures of the bleſſed Sacrament, it is manifeſt, that <hi>Manna</hi> (raigned downe from heauen to feede the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in the deſert) vvas one of the principall; as our Sauiour ſignifieth, <hi>comparing</hi> Manna <hi>and the food which he would giue vs,</hi>

The good fellowes to auoid this inconuenience, are content to yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> as good and vertuous Sacraments as ours be: but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is moſt falſe.<note place="margin">Colloſ. <hi>2.</hi> verſ. <hi>17.</hi> Gal. <hi>4.</hi> Iob. <hi>6.</hi> ver. <hi>49.</hi> &amp; <hi>58.</hi> De ijs qui initiantur miſterijs cap. <hi>9. 1.</hi> Cor. <hi>10.</hi> verſ. <hi>16.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, the Reall preſence of Chriſtes body is proued out of theſe wordes of <hi>S.

And the bread which we breake, is it not the participation of the body of our Lord?</hi> If we receiue and doe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate Chriſtes body and bloud, they are certainely there preſent. And the expoſſition of <hi>S. Chriſoſtome</hi> vpon the ſame place, hath ſtopped vp our aduerſaries ſtarting-hole, who are wont to ſay that we (indeed) doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the bodie of Chriſt, yet not there preſent; but by faith we mount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ſkies: and receiue it there. But what ſaith this holy and learned Doctor void of partiallity?<note place="margin">Homil. <hi>24</hi> in praeora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad Corinth.</note> marry, <hi>that of theſe wordes, this is the ſence and meaning: That which is in the Chalice, is the very ſame that flowed out of Chriſtes ſide.</hi> Note that the bloud of Chriſt is in the Chalice, and ſo we need not runne ſo farre off to ſeeke it: and ſaith further, <hi>that we are made partakers of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23774:25"/> it, with the like reall and cloſe conjunction, as the word of God and the nature of man, were joyned together:</hi> which was not by faith or imagination only; but actually and ſubſtantially. With vvhome accordeth <hi>S. Cyril:</hi> vvho out of the ſame wordes of <hi>S.

                  <hi>doth it not make Christ to dwell in vs bodily, by the participation of the fleſh of Chriſt?</hi> Here by the way obſerue, that the Apoſtle calleth the bleſſed Sacrament bread; either becauſe in exterior appearance, it ſeemeth ſo to be (as Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the ſhape of men, are in holy write commonly called men: ſo the body of Chriſt, being vnder the forme of bread, is called bread) or els, for that bread in Scripture (according to the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> phraſe) ſignifieth al kind of foode. So is <hi>Manna</hi> called bread, which was rather like the dewe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.</note> and ſo may our Sauiours body, which is the moſt ſubſtantiall foode of our ſoules, be called bread, although it be nothing leſſe then ordinary bread. Laſtly, it is ſuch bread, as our Sauiour in expreſſe tearmes hath chriſtened it, when he ſaid: <hi>And the bread which I will giue you, is my fleſh,</hi>

               <p>Our fift argument is taken out of <hi>S.</hi> Paul: <hi>He that eateth and drinketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, eateth and drinketh judgement to himſelfe, not diſcerning the body of our Lord:</hi> and <hi>is guilty of the body and bloud of our Lord:</hi> whence I argue thus. Vnworthy receiuers, who are deſtitute of that faith, whereby they ſhould receiue Chriſt (according vnto the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> opinion) or els they ſhould not receiue vnworthily: ſuch vnworthy communicants (I ſay) doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the body of Chriſt, albeit vnworthily; therefore, it is not the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers faith that maketh it preſent, but it is there preſent by the vvordes of conſecration, whether the party beleeue it or no: or elſe, howe ſhould the man eate his judgement, for not diſcerning Chriſtes body, and be guilty of his body? the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> anſwere firſt, <hi>That he is guilty of the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he receiueth it not then, when he ſhould, for lacke of faith:</hi> But this gloſe is cleane contrary to the text, that ſaith expreſly. That they receiue it <hi>by eating and drinking</hi> of it; but yet <hi>vnworthily:</hi> and all ancient Interpreters doe ſo expound it. Let one <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſerue in ſteed of the reſt, who ſaith:<note place="margin">De baptiſ. contr. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſt. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That like as</hi> Iudas <hi>(to whome our Lord gaue the morſell) gaue place to the Deuill, not by receiuing that which was euill, but by receiuing of it euilly: euen ſo, euery one receiuing our Lordes</hi> Sacrament <hi>vnworthily, doth not make it euill, becauſe he is euill; or receiue nothing, becauſe he receiueth it not to ſaluation. For it was the body and bloud of Chriſt, euen to them of whome the Apoſtle ſaith, He that eateth vnworthily, eateth his owne damnation.</hi> By which notable ſentence of ſo worthy a Prelate, the other cauill of our wrangling young-Maſters, is alſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23774:26"/> confuted. For they (perceiuing that their former ſhift would not ſerue their turnes) fly vnto a ſecond; <hi>that</hi> (forſooth) <hi>the vnworthie receiuer is guilty of Chriſtes body, becauſe he abuſeth the ſigne of it: for the diſhonour done to the picture, redoundeth to the perſon himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> When we complaine of them for diſhonouring of Images, and tel them that they thereby diſhonour the Saints, alleadging this ſentence; <hi>That the diſhonour done to the picture, redoundeth to the perſon:</hi> then they will not allowe of it, which nowe they are glad to take hold of. To the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we ſay firſt, that the Sacrament is no picture of Chriſt, no not in their owne opinion, but a ſigne only: and great difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene disfiguring a mans owne picture, and abuſing of ſome ſigne or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of him: neither is the disfiguring or breaking of a mans picture, ſo heinous a fault, if it be not done expreſly in contempt of the perſon; which formall contempt, is not to be found in many vnworthy receiuers. Laſtly, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that eate <hi>Manna,</hi> or drunke of the <hi>Rocke</hi> vnworthily, were not guilty of Chriſtes body and bloud, although thoſe thinges were ſignes and figures of them: therfore, if there were nothing, but a ſigne of Chriſtes bodie in our Sacrament, no man ſhould be guilty of ſo heynous a crime, for vnworthy receiuing of it: but being by the verdict of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> made <hi>guilty of damnation for not diſcerning Chriſtes bodie,</hi> it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that Chriſtes body is there really preſent.</p>
               <p>To theſe arguments collected out of holy Scriptures, let vs joyne one other of no leſſe authority taken from miracles done in confirmation of the reall preſence. For a true miracle cannot be done to confirme any vntruth: or elſe God (by whoſe only power they are wrought) ſhould te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie an vntruth, which is impoſſible. One miracle, of preſeruing a young boy aliue in a glaſiers hot burning furnace, I haue before rehearſed out of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> cited by M. PER.: two others I will chooſe out of hundreths, becauſe they be recorded in famous Authors, and my purpoſe is to be briefe.<note place="margin">Ex vita per Ioan.

               <hi>Of the Sacrifice in the Lordes ſupper, which the</hi> Papiſts <hi> call the Sacrifice of the</hi> Maſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ouching this point, first I will ſet downe, what must be vnderſtood by the name of Sacrifice. A Sacrifice is taken properly, or vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. Properly, it is a ſacred or ſolemne action, in which man offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and conſecrateth ſome outward bodily thing vnto God, to pleaſe and honour him thereby: improperly and by the way of reſemblance, all the duties of the morall lawe are called ſacrifices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>M. PERKINS definition of a Sacrifice taken properly, is not complete: for it may be applyed vnto many oblations, vvhich vvere not ſacrifices. For example, diuers deuout <hi>Iſraelites</hi> offered ſome gold, ſome ſiluer, ſome other thinges to honour and pleaſe God withall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35.</note> in the building of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle for diuine ſeruice, according to his owne order and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe mens actions were both ſacred and ſolemne, and ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bodily thing, by them vvas offered and conſecrated vnto God, to pleaſe and honour him thereby: therefore, they did properly offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (according to M. PER. definition) which in true diuinity is abſurd, or elſe vvomen and children might be ſacrificers. Againe, if his definition were perfect, I cannot ſee howe they can denie their Lordes ſupper to be a Sacrifice properly. For they muſt needes graunt, that it is a <hi>ſacred or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne action:</hi> and they cannot denie, but that in it a <hi>man offereth and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto God ſome outward bodily thing</hi> (to vvit) bread and vvine; and that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23774:28"/> 
               <hi>to pleaſe and honour God thereby:</hi> ſo that all the parts of M. PER. definition agreeing to it, he cannot denie it to be a Sacrifice properly. We (in deede) that take it to be a prophane or ſuperſtitious action, highly diſpleaſing God, as being by mans inuention brought in, to ſhoulder out his true and only ſeruice; doe vpon juſt reaſon reject it, as no Sacrifice: but the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> that take it for diuine ſeruice, muſt needes admit it to be a proper Sacrifice; &amp; ſo doe they fall by their owne definition, into that damnable abomination (as they tearme it) of maintayning an other proper Sacrifice in the newe Teſtament, beſides Chriſtes death on the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, to make vp the definition perfect, it is to be added: firſt, that that holy action be done by <hi>a lawful Miniſter,</hi> and then that the viſible thing there preſented, be not only offered to God; <hi>but be</hi> alſo <hi>really altered and conſumed, in teſtification of Gods ſoueraigne dominion ouer vs.</hi> We agree in the other improper acception of a Sacrifice, and ſay; that al good workes done to pleaſe and honour God, may be called ſacrifices improperly: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which the inward act of adoration (whereby a deuout minde doth acknowledge God to be the beginning, midle, and end of all good both in heauen &amp; earth, and as ſuch a one, doth moſt humbly proſtrate, honour and adore him) holdeth the moſt worthyeſt ranke; and may truly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an inuiſible and inward Sacrifice: The outward teſtimony and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation thereof, <hi>by conſuming ſome viſible thing, in a ſolemne manner and by a choſen Miniſter, is moſt properly a Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>OVR CONSENT.</head>
               <p>MAſter PERKINS would gladly ſeeme to agree with vs in two points: Firſt, <hi>That the ſupper of the Lord is a Sacrifice, and may truly be ſo called as it is, and hath beene in former ages.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the very body of Christ is offered in the Lordes ſupper.</hi> Howe ſay you to this, are we not herein at perfect concord? a plaine dealing man would thinke ſo, hearing theſe his wordes: but if you reade further, and ſee his expoſition of them, we are as farre at ſquare as may be. For M. PER. in handling this queſtion will (as he ſaith) take a Sacrifice ſometimes <hi>properly</hi> and ſometimes <hi>improperly,</hi> ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the one to the other at his pleaſure, that you cannot know where to haue him. So when he ſaith in his firſt concluſion, <hi>That the ſupper of the Lord is a Sacrifice,</hi> he vnderſtandeth <hi>improperly: yet it is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>called a Sacrifice in three reſpects. Firſt, becauſe it is a memoriall of the reall Sacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſſe.</hi> So a painted Crucifix may be called a Sacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a memoriall of that Sacrifice: but M. PER. addeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>That it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all contayneth a thankes-giuing to God for the ſame: which thankes-giuing is the Sacrifice and calues of our lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:23774:29"/>
               <p>May he not ſeeme worthy of a calues-head to his breakefaſt, that being in a ſerious diſpute of a Sacrifice, would ſay that the thankes-giuing for a Sacrifice, may trulie be called the very ſame Sacrifice it ſelfe? for ſo a thankesgiuing for a howſe, may truly be called a howſe; and the thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing for a horſe, a horſe it ſelfe: and to ſay that the ancient Fathers ſo ſpake (as M. PER. doth) is to make them babes and too too vnſkilfull how to ſpeake. Secondly, (ſaith he) <hi>it may be called a Sacrifice, becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery communicant doth there preſent himſelfe an acceptable Sacrifice to God, to worke in the practiſe of all dutiefull obedience.</hi> You ſhould haue ſaid, that the receiuing of the Lordes ſupper worthily, might rather be called a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then the ſupper it ſelfe, if you put the reaſon of the Sacrifice, only in the receiuers conceit and deuotion, which is very different from the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it ſelfe. Thirdly, (ſaith he) <hi>The Lordes ſupper is called a Sacrifice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of almeſſe giuen to the poore, which was joyned with it: and in this regard alſo the ancient Fathers haue called the Sacrament, an vnbloudy Sacrifice; and the table, an Altar; and the Miniſters,</hi> Prieſts; <hi>and the whole action, an Oblation; not to God, but to the congregation; and not by the</hi> Prieſt <hi>alone, but by the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray you take not the ancient Fathers for ſo ſimple, as to thinke the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be a Sacrifice, becauſe ſome almes might happily be (then and there) giuen to the poore: For they teach that a Sacrifice, is a ſoueraigne ſeruice done vnto God alone, and not to be offered to any mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Libr. <hi>20.</hi> cont.

Nowe <hi>Deacons</hi> might not in any caſe offer Sacrifice, as the whole Church in her purity defined, at the Councel of <hi>Nice:</hi> wherefore, there is no colour to ſay, that the vnbloudy <hi>Sacrifice, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> were ſo called in reſpect of almes giuen to the congregation. we denie not, but that deuout people offered at <hi>Maſſe</hi> time, either bread and wine towardes the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> or money towardes the reliefe of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and maintainance of the Altar: but that was not called the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> by the Fathers, but diſtinguiſhed from it expreſly.

PER. falſely tranſlateth, <hi>ferre obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem ad altare Dei</hi>) that he plainely teacheth the contrarie, the place of their captiuity affording them, neither Altars nor <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Now both thoſe captiue <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Babilon,</hi> and theſe captiue virgins, might and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly faſt and pray, and might alſo to their power giue almes; and yet (as teſtifieth <hi>S. Augustine</hi>) they could not offer Sacrifice, becauſe they wanted a conuenient place, <hi>Prieſtes,</hi> and Altars: wherevpon it followeth moſt euidently (euen by the teſtimony which M. PER. alleadgeth for himſelfe) that the giuing of Almes, and other godly deuotions of lay-men, doe not make <hi>Priests</hi> and Altars, or giue them their names; but be moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct thinges from them, as ſhall more amply be ſhewed hereafter out of the ancient Fathers, who make the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> a moſt proper kinde of Sacrifice? yet vnbloudie, becauſe ther is no bloud ſhed there, but the body and bloud of Chriſt are offered vnder the formes of bread and wine: not (as M. PER. ſaith in his ſecond concluſion) <hi>in figure only and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation;</hi> but alſo really and moſt truly. We denie not the Sacrifice of Chriſtes body in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> to be a repreſentation of Chriſtes ſuffering on the Croſſe; but affirme it to be ſuch a repreſentation, as contayneth withall, the ſame reall body there vnbloudily ſacrificed; which <hi>S.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Chriſtians doe celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the</hi> Sacrifice <hi>(already performed on the Croſſe) by the very holy Oblation and participation of the body of Christ:</hi> we ſay therefore with the ſame author, by M. PER. alleadged, <hi>That Sacraments haue the reſemblance of thinges, whereof they are the Sacramentes;</hi> but ſay further, that beſides the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, <hi>they containe alſo the thinges which they reſemble.</hi> As baptiſme hath by waſhing the body outwardlie, a reſemblance of waſhing the ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly from ſinnes; and withall doth when it is miniſtred truly, waſh and purge it from all ſinne. So that it is a foule kinde of reaſoning in the matter of Sacraments, to argue thus as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> vſe; <hi>It is the ſigne or the repreſentation of ſuch a thing; therefore the thing it ſelfe is not there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</hi> whereas the contrary is moſt certaine; that it is the ſigne of ſuch a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23774:30"/> thing, <hi>ergo.</hi> the thing it ſelfe is there preſent; becauſe all Sacraments of the newe Teſtament, doe containe and worke that which they ſignifie, as ſhall be more amply proued in his proper place. Neither doe we denie, but that by a true faith in Chriſt and his paſſion (ſo it vvant not other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of Chriſtian religion) a man is made partaker of the merit of it. But what is that againſt the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe?</hi> one truth doth not diſproue an other: but we ſhall heare the man (perhaps) argue more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially anone, when he draweth nearer the matter.

               <p>Obſerue, that in the lawe of <hi>Moyſes</hi> there vvere three kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacrifices; one called <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> or vvhole burnt offeringes; the ſecond <hi>an Hoſt for ſinne,</hi> of vvhich there were alſo diuers ſortes; the third <hi>an Hoſt of pacification.

               <p>Nowe vve following the ancient Fathers doctrine, doe hold the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> to ſucceede all theſe ſacrifices, and to contayne the vertue and efficacy of all three, to vvit: it is offered both to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God to be the ſupreame Lord of heauen and earth, and that all our good commeth from him: as vvitneſſeth this oblation of his deare Sonnes body, who being the Lord of heauen and earth, vvillingly ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death to ſhewe his obedience to his Father. Secondly, it is offered to appeaſe Gods vvrath, juſtly kindled againſt vs ſinners, repreſenting to him therein, the merit of Chriſtes paſſion to obtaine our pardon.

Theſe points of our doctrine being openly laide before the eyes of the

               <p>True, but your arguing out of it is ſomewhat vaine. For after your owne opinion, it is the <hi>Priest</hi> that doth offer the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſtes body in the Lordes ſupper: and therefore, though Chriſt offered it but once (as the Apoſtle ſaith) yet <hi>Prieſts</hi> appointed by him, may offer it many times. Doe yee perceiue howe eaſily your Achilles may be foiled? the good-man not looking (belike) for this anſwere, ſaith nothing to it, but frameth another in our names, vvhich is alſo good and true, to vvit: <hi>That the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh of the bloudy</hi> Sacrifice <hi>of Chriſt on the Croſſe, which was but once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: which letteth not, but that the ſame his body, may be vnder the formes of bread and wine ſacrificed often, by the Miniſtery of</hi> Prieſtes <hi>in the</hi> Maſſe: Yes, but it doth (ſaith M.

                  <hi>as the high</hi> Prieſtes <hi>did, &amp;c.</hi> All this is true, that Chriſt ſuffered but once vpon the Croſſe; but it is nothing againſt the former anſwere, in which it is not ſaid, that Chriſt offered himſelfe twiſe vpon the Croſſe; but that the ſame his body is daylie, by the Miniſtery of <hi>Prieſtes,</hi> offered vnbloudily vnder the formes of bread and wine, vpon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23774:31"/> the Altar: which being ſo plaine and ſenſible, a man might meruaile at their palpable groſſeneſſe, if they cannot conceiue it. I thinke rather that they vnderſtand it well enough; but not knowing what reaſonably to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply againſt it, doe make as though they vnderſtood it not: Whereupon, this man (not hauing ſaid one vvord to the purpoſe againſt the anſwere) yet concludeth (as though he had confuted all that we haue in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for this Sacrifice) <hi>That the Scriptures</hi> (forſooth) <hi>neuer knewe the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner of ſacrificing Chriſt:</hi> and then goeth on triumphing, <hi>That euery diſtinction in diuinity not founded in the written word, is but a forgery of mans braine.</hi> Had he not need of a meſſe of good broath, to coole his hotte haſty braine, that thus runneth away with a ſuppoſed victory, before he hath ſtrooken any one good ſtroke? but he ſaith further (cleane beſides the drift of his former argument, as his manner is, ſometime to droppe downe a ſentence by the way,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.</note> which ſeemeth to make for him) <hi>That without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud, there is no remiſsion of ſinnes:</hi> meaning (belike) that if our <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be vnbloudy, then it doth not remit ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> If no remiſſion of ſinne be obtayned nowe, without ſhedding of bloud: howe haue they remiſſion of their ſinnes by only faith? vvhat, doth their faith drawe bloud of them? The direct anſwere is apparant in the Apoſtles vvordes, vvho ſaith: <hi>That all thinges almost, according to the lawe are cleanſed with bloud: and that there was no remiſsion of ſinnes (in the lawe of</hi> Moyſes) <hi>without ſhedding of bloud.</hi> What a ſhamefull abuſing of a text vvas this, to apply that to vs in the ſtate of the newe Teſtament, vvhich vvas plainely ſpoken of the ſtate of the old Teſtament, and of <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawe?</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon: <hi>The</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church holdeth, that the Sacrifice in the Lordes ſupper, is all one for ſubſtance, with the Sacrifice offered on the Croſſe: if that be ſo, then the Sacrifice in the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>muſt either be a continuance of the Sacrifice begunne on the Croſſe, or elſe an alternation or repetition of it. Let them chooſe of theſe twaine which they will. If they ſay, it is a continuance of it, then they make the</hi> Prieſt <hi>to bring to perfection, that which Christ begunne: If they ſay it is a repetition, thus alſo they make it imperfect. For to repeate a thing often, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth that at once it was not ſufficient; which is the reaſon of the holy Ghost, to proue the ſacrifices of the old Teſtament to be imperfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere, that vvhen an argument conſiſteth of diuiſion, then if any part or member of the diuiſion be omitted, the argument is nought worth, as the learned knowe: ſo fareth it in this fallacy. For the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is neither a continuance of the Sacrifice on the Croſſe, not for M. PER. friuolous reaſon (for not all thinges are bettered, but many made much vvorſe by continuance) but becauſe the one is not immediately
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23774:32"/> lincked with the other, there going much time betweene them. Neither is it (to ſpeake properly) a repetition of the Sacrifice of the Croſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was bloudy, this vnbloudy; that, offered by Chriſt in his owne perſon; this, by the miniſtery of a <hi>Prieſt:</hi> that, on the Croſſe, this, on the Altar: that, to pay the generall ranſome, and to purchaſe the redemption of all mankind, this, to apply the vertue of that vnto particuler men: So that although there be in both theſe Sacrifices, the ſame body and bloud of Chriſt in ſubſtance; yet, the manner, meanes, and end of them, being ſo different, the one cannot conueniently be called the repetion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is a <hi>liuely repreſentation</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on the Croſſe, and <hi>the application of the vertue</hi> of it to vs. This is the third member of the diuiſion, either not knowne, or concealed by M. PER. the better to colour and cloake the deceite of his ſecond falſe argument. Nowe to the third.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon. <hi>A reall and outward Sacrifice in a Sacrament, is againſt the nature of a Sacrament, and ſpecially the ſupper of the Lord: for one of the endes thereof, is to keepe in memory the Sacrifice of Chriſt. Nowe euery remembrance muſt be of a thing abſent, paſt, and done: and if Christ be daylie really ſacrificed, the Sacrament is not a fit memoriall of his Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Chriſtes <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered on the Croſſe, is long ſithence paſt and done, and therefore abſent: wherefore, it may well haue a memoriall; and there can be no other ſo liuely repreſentation of it, as to haue the ſame body (yet in another manner) ſet before our eyes, as hath beene more then once already declared, which may ſerue to anſwere the later propoſition.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS confirmeth his former thus: <hi>The principall end of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that God may giue, and we receiue Chriſt and his benefits. Nowe in a reall ſacrifice, God doth not giue Christ to vs, but the</hi> Prieſt <hi>offereth vp Christ to God: therefore, one thing cannot be both a Sacrament and a Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> One and the ſame thing may well be both, but in diuers reſpects. It is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in that it is an holy Oblation of a ſenſible thing vnto God, by conſuming of it in teſtification of his Soueraignity: It is a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as it is a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible grace, beſtowed then vpon the receiuer. So was the <hi>Paſchall lambe</hi> firſt ſacrificed to God (as ſhall be proued hereafter) and after eaten in a Sacrament. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the holy body and bloud of Chriſt, are (vnder the viſible formes of bread and wine) offered vp firſt to God, by the ſacred action of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and after broken and eaten, in recognizance of his ſupreame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer all creatures: which is a Sacrifice moſt properly taken. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is inſtituted by Chriſt to ſignifie and worke the ſpiritual nuriture of our ſoules by receiuing of it: and ſo it is a Sacrament.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:23774:32"/>
               <p>M. PERKINS fourth reaſon. <hi>The holy Ghost maketh a difference,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt, the high</hi> Prieſt <hi>of the newe Testament, and all the</hi> Leuiticall Prieſtes; <hi>in this, that they were many, one ſucceding another: but he is only one, hauing an eternall</hi> Preeſt-ood, <hi>which cannot paſſe from him to any other. Nowe if this difference be good, then Chriſt alone in his owne perſon, muſt be the</hi> Prieſt <hi>of the newe Teſtament, and no other with, or vnder him: If they ſay that the whole action is done in the perſon of Christ, and that the</hi> Prieſt <hi>is but his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and an inſtrument vnder him (as they ſay in deede) I ſay againe, it is falſe, becauſe the whole Oblation is acted by the</hi> Prieſt, <hi>and he that doth all, is more then a bare inſtrument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> To beginne with that, which he ſaith laſt (becauſe I muſt ſtay longer on the firſt) he bewrayeth his ignorance in the matter of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> when he ſaith; that the <hi>Priest</hi> acteth the whole Oblation in his owne name, and not as the miniſter of Chriſt: for the principall part of both Sacrifice and Sacrament, conſiſteth in the conſecration, as we holde; which the <hi>Prieſt</hi> wholy executeth in the name and perſon of Chriſt. For conſecrating he ſaith, <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon of Chriſt; and not in his owne perſon, ſaying, this is Chriſtes body: in like ſorte he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrateth the Chalice, <hi>This is the Chalice of my bloud.</hi> So that nothing is more certaine, then that the Sacrifice of our Lordes ſupper is offered by the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as the Miniſter and inſtrument of Chriſt: wherefore M. PER. pithagorically (I ſay againe) is conuinced to be moſt vntrue. Nowe to the former part of his miſtaking the Apoſtles diſcourſe, which is farre more profound then the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> take it to be: for his purpoſe is to proue, that <hi>Conſummation</hi> (as he there ſpeaketh) <hi>was not by the</hi> Leuiticall <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> that is;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</note> that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawe could not offer vp ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, by vertue whereof Gods juſtice could be ſatisfied, and the redemption of all mankinde purchaſed. For if any of the high <hi>Prieſts</hi> could haue performed that, there needed not to haue beene many <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or any one ſucceſſor to an other, becauſe the former ſhould ſufficiently haue done that already, vvhich the later vvent about to doe: wherefore, the Apoſtle concludeth that it vvas neceſſary, that an other <hi>Priest</hi> ſhould riſe according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedecke,</hi> whoſe one oblation ſhould be ſo pretious in Gods ſight, and of ſuch infinite value, that it ſhould neede, neyther to be offered twice, nor to haue the ſupply of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrifice: vvhich vve vvillingly graunt, and teach daylie; but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alvvaies in minde that the Apoſtle there, treateth only of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate Sacrifice, vvhich procured the generall redemption of all men, and payed the juſt price vnto God, for the ſinnes of the vvhole vvorld: of vvhich ſort, vvee acknoweledge that Sacrifice vvhich our Sauiour
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23774:33"/> offered on the Croſſe, to be the only <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> fully ſatisfying the rigour of Gods juſtice, for the offences of all the world, and as plentifully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing all kinde of graces, to be beſtowed vpon all degrees of men; ſo that it needeth not to be repeated it ſelfe, or to haue any ſupply from any other <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> But all this doth no more proue, that our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is not a true and proper <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> then that the <hi>Leuiticall ſacrifices</hi> were no <hi>ſacrifices.</hi> For <hi>S. Paules</hi> ſcope is not to proue, that there were not, or ſhould not be any more <hi>ſacrifices</hi> but one: but that there can be but one ſuch an abſolute and perfect <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> as Chriſtes was on the Croſſe. Well then if that one <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of Chriſt on the Croſſe, be ſo complete and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, what neede is there of any other <hi>ſacrifice?</hi> great neede, and that for three cauſes. Firſt, to repreſent and keepe better in minde that ſinguler <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> which can by no meanes be ſo liuely repreſented, as by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of the ſelfe ſame thinges in ſubſtance, albeit after an other manner. Secondly, to conuey and apply the vertue of that on the Croſſe, vnto all obedient Chriſtians. For it is to be obſerued, though Chriſt paide in his body the ranſome of all ſinners, and purchaſed Gods grace for them: yet, no man vvas thereby only freede from his ſinnes and receiued into grace; but euery one muſt vſe the meanes ordained by Chriſt, to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of that heauenly fauour. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hold faith alone to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes: but we more truly ſay, that the <hi>Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> are principal conduict pipes, to conuey the ſtreames of Gods grace into our ſoules, as ſhall be proued hereafter. The third cauſe, vvhy vve muſt haue a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> to be offered daylie in the ſtate of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is; that men may meete ſolemnely at it, to doe their fealty and chiefe homage vnto God: which ſhall alſo in this queſtion be proued more at large. Thus haue we briefly ſhewed, howe there is one abſolute <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> and howe after the ſame, there yet remaineth an other; which may be the better vnderſtood, if we conſider, that the vertue of Chriſtes <hi>ſacrifice</hi> on the Croſſe, did vvorke the ſaluation of men, euen from the beginning of the world:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.</note> whereupon, <hi>Christ is called a lambe, ſlaine from the beginning.</hi> Now moſt euident it is, that notwithſtanding the al-ſufficiency of Chriſtes only <hi>ſacrifice</hi> on the Croſſe, as well then in force, as nowe, there were both in the lawe of nature, and of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> diuers other <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> of which ſome were to purge from ſinne: why therefore, may there not aſwell be one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſince his paſſion? If their <hi>ſacrifices</hi> then, when Chriſtes <hi>ſacrifice</hi> on the Croſſe vvas as preſent, and in as full force vvith God, could ſtand vvell vvith it, vvithout any derogation vnto the full vertue of it: vvhy cannot ours aſwell alſo doe ſo nowe?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</note> If you ſay, <hi>That Chriſt by one oblation hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated or made perfect, them that be ſanctified:</hi> therefore nowe there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23774:33"/> no more. I anſwere (as before) that Chriſt by that ſame one <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> obtained at his fathers handes, a generall pardon for all mankinde, and all grace to be beſtowed vpon them, euen from the beginning of the world, in ſuch ſort as he thought beſt: and that his one <hi>oblation,</hi> doth no more exclude other <hi>Sacrifices</hi> ſince the time of his paſſion, then it did other <hi>oblations</hi> before, which all are as dependents on it, and meanes to keepe it freſh in memory, and to apply the vertue and meritte of that one <hi>oblation,</hi> vnto all men.</p>
               <p>I vrge yet further for the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to ſupply M. PERKINS negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and that this hard point may be the better vnderſtood; and adde out of <hi>S. Paul:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem verſ. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Where there is remiſsion of theſe</hi> (iniquities) <hi>nowe there is no oblation for ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True, ſuch an <hi>oblation</hi> as Chriſt offered on the Croſſe; <hi>ſo vertuous,</hi> to wipe away all iniquities; <hi>ſo pretious,</hi> to pay a generall ranſome: but there may be an other auailable to entreate and deſerue, that the vertue of the former generall, may be deriued vnto men in particuler; becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe ſinnes and iniquities were vnto Chriſt pardoned in general: yet, at his death, or by it only, thoſe ſinnes were not remitted and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto any man in particuler; ſo that it was meete and requiſite, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to purchaſe that generall redemption, there ſhould be an other, to apply the vertue of it in particuler. And thus much of this argument: not that it deſerued (as it was propoſed nakedly by M. PER.) any more then a flat deniall; but to explicate this difficulty, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete ſome obſcure places of <hi>S. Paul</hi> omitted by M. PERKINS.</p>
               <p>M. PER. fift reaſon. <hi>If the</hi> Prieſt <hi>doe offer to God Chriſtes reall body and bloud, for the pardon of our ſinnes; then man is become a mediator betweene God and Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This illation is too too ridiculous. Is he Chriſtes mediator, that asketh forgiuenes of ſinnes for Chriſtes ſake? then are al Chriſtians mediators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and Chriſt: for we all preſent vnto God Chriſts paſſion, and beſeech him (for the meritte thereof) to pardon vs our ſinnes. I hope that we may both lawfully pray vnto God, and alſo imploy our beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, that Chriſt may be truly knowne, rightly honoured and ſerued of all men, without incroaching vpon Chriſts mediation. Theſe be ſeruices we owe vnto Chriſt, and the bounden duties of good Chriſtians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it hath pleaſed him to imploy vs, as his ſeruantes and miniſters; not as his mediators. But Maſter PERKINS addeth, that vve requeſt in the Cannon of the <hi>Maſſe, That God will accept our gifts and offerings (namely Christ himſelfe offered) as he did the Sacrifices of</hi> Abell <hi>and</hi> Noe (he would haue ſaid <hi>Abraham,</hi> for <hi>Noe</hi> is not there mentioned.) True, in the ſence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23774:34"/> there following; not that this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſtes body, is not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more gratefull vnto him, then was the Sacrifices of the beſt men: but that this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which is ſo acceptable of it ſelfe, may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the partakers of it, <hi>cauſe of all heauenly grace and benediction;</hi> and that alſo, <hi>through the ſame Christ our Lord,</hi> as it there followeth in the <hi>Canon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſixt and laſt reaſon, <hi>Is the judgement of the ancient Church,</hi> which is the feebleſt of al the reſt; for that he hath not one place, which maketh not flat againſt himſelfe:<note place="margin">Conc. Tol. <hi>12.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Is not this a fit teſtimony to proue, that there is no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe?</hi> whereas it teacheth the quite contrary, to wit: that there were at that time <hi>Prieſts</hi> that did offer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> daily; but were complained on and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for that they did not themſelues communicate of euery <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which they offered.

                  <hi>Chriſt is ſacrificed for vs myſtically, and his paſsion is giuen vs in miſtery.</hi> Very good: in the miſtery of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> Chriſt is ſacrificed for vs; not as he was on the Croſſe bloudily, but in miſtery (that is) vnder the formes of bread and wine: which may ſerue to anſwere al that he citeth out of <hi>Paſchaſius;</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering, that in that whole treatiſe, and one or two other of the ſame Authour, his principall butte and marke is, to proue the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Sacrifice. In the firſt Chapter of the booke cited by M. PER. he hath theſe wordes: <hi>Our Lord hath done all thinges in heauen and earth, as he will himſelfe, and becauſe it hath ſo pleaſed him, though the figure of bread and wine be here</hi> (that is) <hi>in the Sacrament: notwithſtanding it is to be beleeued, that after conſecration, there is nothing elſe, but the fleſh and bloud of Christ;</hi> vvhich he alſo expreſly proueth there at large. And in an other treatiſe of the ſame argument, he hath theſe, among many ſuch like wordes. <hi>Chriſt, when he gaue his Diſciples bread and broke it, did not ſay, this is a figure of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor in this miſtery there is a certaine vertue of it: but he ſaid without diſsimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> This is my body, <hi>and therefore it is that which he ſaid it was, and not that which men imagine it to be.</hi> Did I not tell you that this <hi>Abbot</hi> vvas like to helpe M.

For it can be no good reaſon vvhy <hi>Melchiſedecke</hi> was a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> for that he bleſſed <hi>Abraham:</hi> for <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>Priest</hi> as well as he; and often offered <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as wel as <hi>Melchiſedecke</hi> did.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23774:36"/> and wine, becauſe he was a <hi>Prieſt</hi> that vſed to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in that kinde; and to honour and thanke God for that victory, he either did then preſently or before had ſacrificed it; and as ſuch ſanctified foode, made a preſent vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> of it, who needed not, either for himſelfe, or for his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers any victuals, becauſe he retourned loaden vvith the ſpoile of foure Kinges: wherefore, the bread and wine that he brought forth, was a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> and not common meate. And if further proofe needed, this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirmed by the Fathers already cited, who all teach, that bread and wine brought forth then by him, were <hi>Melchiſedecke</hi> his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> &amp; a figure of ours. I will yet adde one more, out of that moſt ancient Patriarke <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

Why then
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23774:36"/> ſhould we not take it there, as it doth vſually and properly ſignifie, rather then improperly? not any reaſon doth he render for it at all: but becauſe it made ſo plaine againſt him, he muſt needes ſhift it off ſo wel as he could. But what if in the very place, where he ſaith it is taken <hi>for to kill only,</hi> and not for to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> he be alſo deceiued? then hath he no colour to ſay, that in any place it is taken otherwiſe. Surely, the reaſon that he alleageth for it, is very inſufficient. For by <hi>Iacobs</hi> bretheren inuited to his feaſt, may be vnderſtood according to the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> phraſe, men of his owne religion who might well come to his Sacrifice: wherefore, <hi>S.

               <p>Wherefore, Maſter PERKINS prouideth an other anſwere to our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and ſaith: <hi>That if it were graunted, that the paſſe-ouer were both a</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <hi>and</hi> Sacrament: <hi>yet, would it make much againſt them.

               </p>
               <p>What is this a Gods bleſſing? if that be all the vſe of it, the Lordes ſupper may alſo bee no Sacrament at all: for many other thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Sacraments increaſe our communion with Chriſt. But to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: our Lordes ſupper, and alſo the <hi>Paſchall lambe</hi> vvere inſtituted, not only to increaſe our communion vvith Chriſt; but alſo to render thankes to God for benefits receiued: as their <hi>Paſchall</hi> for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery out of the land of bondage; ſo our <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> for our redemption from ſinne and hell: and therefore, as they are <hi>Sacraments</hi> to feede our ſoules; ſo are they true Sacrifices to giue thankes to God for ſo high and ſinguler benefits.

                  <hi>I will take no pleaſure in you (ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes) and I will not receiue a gift from your handes: for from the</hi> Eaſt <hi>vnto the</hi> Weſt, <hi>great is my name among the</hi> Gentils, <hi>and in euery place a cleane</hi> oblation <hi>is ſacrificed to my name.</hi> Hence we inferre, that after the reprobation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and calling of the <hi>Gentils</hi> (that is in the ſtate of the newe Teſtament) a cleane <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſhall be offered vnto God of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> being made Chriſtians; as vvitneſſeth the ſpirit of God in the holy Prophet: <hi>ergo.</hi> it cannot be denyed of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS anſwereth, <hi>That by that cleane</hi> Sacrifice <hi>is to be vnderſtood the ſpirituall</hi> Sacrifice <hi>of prayers: becauſe that the Apoſtle exhorting vs to pray for all ſtates, hath theſe wordes; Lifting vp pure handes.</hi>

               <p>What good Sir, are cleane handes and a cleane <hi>Sacrifice</hi> all one vvith you? a worſhipfull expoſition. This man conferreth places of Scripture very handſomely together, and would no doubt, write a faire Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary vpon the text, if he were let alone: but yet, tell me (I pray you) by the way, howe Chriſtians can lift vp ſuch pure handes, and offer ſo cleane a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> if al their beſt workes be defiled with ſinne, and no cleaner then a filthy menſtruous cloute as you doe teach? But to confute him directly; our Lord ſpeaketh there to the <hi>Prieſtes</hi> of the old lawe, and rebuketh them ſharpely, for their fault committed in their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> offered to him: and therefore foretelleth them, that he will reject al their Sacrifices, and accept of an other cleane <hi>Sacrifice</hi> among the <hi>Gentils.</hi> Nowe as <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the former part of his ſpeach is taken moſt properly, as no man can denie: ſo muſt it be in the latter; or elſe, there were a great equiuocation in that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and no plaine oppoſition of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to Sacrifice; cleane, to pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And if he had reprehended the <hi>Iewes</hi> for their vnpure prayers, then had it beene correſpondent to haue ſaid, that he vvould haue receiued cleane prayers of others, in lieu of them: but inueighing againſt <hi>Prieſtes</hi> and <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> the very order and proportion of the ſentence neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that for thoſe euill <hi>Prieſtes,</hi> and poluted ſacrifices, he would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh good <hi>Prieſtes,</hi> and cleane <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> according vnto the proper ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the wordes. Againe, God is not ſo extreamely bent againſt the <hi>Iewes</hi> nowe, but that he would receiue the ſpirituall Sacrifice of prayer and thankes-giuing, euen from them, if they doe offer it; but he ſpeaketh there of a kinde of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that he vvill not receiue from their handes: therefore, that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> cannot be vnderſtood, to be any ſuch ſpirituall
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23774:37"/> thing; but a true &amp; proper kind of Sacrifice. And <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> (whome M. PER. citeth) is ſo farre off from ſaying, ſupplications and thanks-giuing to be the only perfect Sacrifices that Chriſtians haue, that in the very ſame Dialogue, he applieth this propheſie of <hi>Malachie,</hi> vnto the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> ſaying: <hi>That euen then,</hi> Malachie <hi>the Prophet did ſpeake of our</hi> Sacrifices <hi>which are offered vp in all places,</hi> to wit: of the <hi>bread and Chalice of the Euchariſt;</hi> which his equall <hi>Ireneus</hi> (cited alſo by M.

               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt at his last ſupper did properly ſacrifice vnto God, his owne body and bloud, vnder the formes of bread and wine: but what Chriſt then and there did, the ſame is to be done in the Church by his ordinance, vntill the worldes end:</hi> ergo.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23774:38"/> 
                  <hi>There is and alwayes muſt be, a proper Sacrifice in the true Church.</hi> They doe denie, that Chriſt offered any ſuch <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in his laſt ſupper: we proue it thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> by his owne wordes. For he ſaith, <hi>That his body which he gaue them to eate, was euen then giuen for them to God: &amp; that his bloud was then preſently ſhed for remiſsion of their ſinnes.</hi> But to offer his body and bloud to God, by ſuch a ſacred action, and vnder ſuch viſible creatures to be there eaten, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to Sacrifice, <hi>ergo.</hi> Chriſt at his laſt ſupper did properly offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. They anſwere, that albeit it be ſaid in the preſent tenſe, <hi>then giuen and ſhedde:</hi> yet the meaning is, that it ſhould be giuen only the morrowe after, on the Croſſe; the preſent tenſe being put for the future: &amp; further adde, that in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> the verbe is put in the future tenſe.</p>
               <p>We reply, that men may not at their pleaſure change tenſes; or elſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> might defend, that our <hi>Meſsias</hi> were not yet borne: and if we proue it, ſaying; <hi>The</hi> Word <hi>is made fleſh:</hi> they may (by this licence of changing the preſent tenſe into the future) ſay, that it is not ſo yet, but it ſhall be hereafter: therefore, to flie vnto chopping and changing the text, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſon or authority, is rather to ſhift off, then to defend a cauſe well. But (ſay they) it is in the Maſſe booke, <hi>effundetur.</hi> God helpe the poore men, that louing the <hi>Maſſe</hi> no better, are driuen yet from the plaine text of holy Scripture, to flie to the Maſſe-booke for ſuccour: but it vvill not ſerue their turne, becauſe both are true, and agree vvell together. For Chriſtes bloud vnder the forme of vvine, vvas preſently ſacrificed and ſhedde at his laſt ſupper; and the ſame in his owne forme, vvas to be ſhedde the morrowe after on the Croſſe: and againe, vnder the forme of wine alſo, was to be ſhedde in the ſame Sacrament vnto the worldes end; ſo that truly &amp; properly both may be ſaid <hi>it is ſhedde,</hi> and <hi>it ſhall be ſhedde:</hi> and a good Interpreter of Scripture may not to delude the one, flie to the other, but defend both, becauſe both be the vvordes of the holy Ghoſt. And the <hi>Greeke</hi> text in <hi>S. Luke</hi> doth inuincibly confirme, that the vvordes are to be taken in the preſent tenſe. For it hath; that the bloud as in the Chalice,<note place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr conſent may be ſet downe in three concluſions. Firſt, we doe not condemne faſting, but maintayne three ſortes of it, to wit: a morall, a ciuill, and a religious fast. A morall fast is a practiſe of ſobriety or temperance. When as in the vſe of meates and drinkes, the appetite is reſtrayned, that it doe not exceede moderation: and this muſt be vſed of all Chriſtians, in the whole courſe of their liues. A ciuill faſt is, when vpon ſome politike conſideration men abſtayne from certaine meates: as in our common weale, the lawe enjoyneth vs to abſtayne from fleſh at certaine ſeaſons of the yeare, for theſe ſpeciall endes; to preſerue the breede of cattell, and to maintayne the calling of fiſher-men.</hi>

               <p>Obſerue by the way, that if he meane the faſt of Lent (as it is moſt likely by his wordes) he is fouly deceiued in the <hi>ſpeciall endes of it;</hi> which are not thoſe vvorldly reſpects by him mentioned, but principally others more ſpirituall and heauenly, to wit: Firſt, the puniſhment of our owne fleſh, for the faultes committed in ouermuch eating the whole yeare before; as<note n="*" place="margin">Serm. <hi>4.</hi> de Quadr.

We denie not, but that many times ſpirituall exerciſes, doe bring with them temporall commodities; but thoſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and accidentary vnto them, not the ſpeciall cauſes of them: and in Countries farre diſtant from the Sea, vvhere are no ſuch fiſher-men, the Lent is obſerued as dulie as in our Iland, inuironed with the Sea.</p>
               <p>Nowe to <hi>the third kinde of faſting,</hi> maintayned by M. PER., but ſeldome practiſed by his followers, which he calleth <hi>religious: becauſe the duties of religion (as the exerciſe of prayer and humiliation) be practiſed during the time of this faſt.</hi> But he doth amiſſe, to put this for one of the points of our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for vve eſteeme faſting it ſelfe (vvhen it is done, to appeaſe Gods vvrath, and to honour him in our humiliation) to be an eſſentiall part of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:23774:42"/> Gods worſhippe; which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> denie, and ſay: that <hi>faſting is only tearmed religious, becauſe during the time of it, by prayers and preaching, and ſuch like, they worſhippe God:</hi> but ſo the very <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place</hi> it ſelfe may be tearmed alſo <hi>religious,</hi> and many other ſuch odde thinges; becauſe they doe alſo concurre with actes of religion.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to his ſecond concluſion, to wit: <hi>We joyne with them in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the principall and right endes of a religious faſt, and they are three. The firſt, that thereby the minde may become attentiue in meditation of the duties of Godlines, to be by vs performed. The ſecond, that the rebellion of the fleſh may be ſubdued: for the fleſh pampered, becommeth an inſtrument of licentiouſneſſe. The third, and</hi> (if he miſtake not) <hi>the chiefeſt end of a religious faſt, is; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our guiltineſſe, and to teſtifie our humiliation before God for our ſinnes: and for this end in the faſtes of the</hi> Niniuites, <hi>the very beaſtes were made to abſtayne.</hi> Hitherto Maſter PERKINS.</p>
               <p>We beſides the three afore-ſaid endes, adde diuers others: as to puniſh &amp; chaſtiſe our fleſh for former offences, which is an act of juſtice: to obey the Churches commandement, which is a religious obedience; and at this time it may be an act of profeſſing the <hi>Catholike</hi> faith, when we obſerue ſet faſtings, to make profeſſion of our faith: and to faſt, thereby to imitate and pleaſe our head Chriſt <hi>Ieſus,</hi> is an act of perfect charity.</p>
               <p>But let vs returne vnto M. PERKINS third concluſion, which is: <hi>We yeeld vnto them, that faſting is a helpe and furtherance vnto the worſhippe of God: yea, and a good worke alſo (if it be vſed in good manner) allowed of God, and to be highly eſteemed of all the ſeruants of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is good: but whereas he ſaith that <hi>faſting in it ſelfe, is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different;</hi> he abuſeth the name of faſting, taking it to ſignifie all manner of abſtinence from meate and drinke: and ſo (in deede) it is in it ſelfe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, &amp; may be either good or badde, as if one ſhould abſtaine from foode to pine himſelfe away. But faſting being properly taken, <hi>ſignifieth an abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meate, according vnto ſome ſet rule of the</hi> Catholike <hi>Church, the better to pleaſe and ſerue God: and ſo it is of it ſelfe, an act of the true worſhippe of God.</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:23774:43"/> circumſpect and judicious Doctors minde, then to thinke or teach, that there vvas no certayne time of faſting to be obſerued? true it is, that he found not expreſly in holy Scripture, this certaine time defined.

               <p>See the place (gentle reader) either in the <hi>Greeke</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> text, except that of <hi>Baſil;</hi> and thou ſhalt finde there theſe only vvordes cited out of Apollonius: <hi>That</hi> Montanus <hi>made newe lawes of faſting,</hi> not that he vvas the firſt that made any lawes of faſting; but was noted as an <hi>Heretike</hi> for making <hi>newe lawes</hi> of faſting. Whence it plainely followeth, that there were other old lawes of faſting before his time, which contented not his humour, but taking pride in his owne inuention (as all <hi>Heretikes</hi> doe) he was not ſatisfied with one Lent, but would haue three Lents euery yeare: and vpon euery faſting day, commanded all his adherents to touch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, vntill the Sunne were ſet; and then they ſhould eate neither fleſh nor fiſh, nor ought elſe hotte or moiſt; but cold, drie, and hard thinges.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> God hauing commanded faſting as <hi>a part of his worſhippe then,</hi> (as M. PER. confeſſeth) it being no <hi>judiciall</hi> or <hi>ceremoniall</hi> part of the lawe, but <hi>morall,</hi> and appertayning to the maſtring of euery mans owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled concupiſcence; he did ſufficiently teach al conſiderate men, that it was alwayes to be vſed <hi>for part of his worſhippe;</hi> for that alwayes men ſhould ſtand in neede of it, they being alwayes ſubject to the ſame rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of their fleſh. And though we be freed from all vncleane meates of the lawe, and from the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſet times of faſting: yet, the band of faſting remayneth, becauſe the reaſon of it is ſtill in force; and we are ſubject to the Paſtours of the Church, and bound to obey them, for the time and manner of our faſting.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond argument. The Gouernours of the Sinagogue had full power and authority to preſcribe ſet times of faſting, and all the people of God vvere bound to obey them therein, as appeareth in the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> who maketh mention of the faſtes of the fourth, fift,<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>7.</hi> verſ. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; Cap. <hi>8.</hi> verſ. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> eight and ninth Monethes; which were not commanded by the lawe, but afterward enjoyned by the rulers of the Church. Nowe then, if the Paſtours of that Sinagogue had ſuch authority, much more haue the Prelates of the church nowe ſince Chriſtes time, who hath indued them with much more ample authority, then the <hi>Iewes</hi> had before Chriſt. M. PER. anſwereth, that <hi>thoſe faſtes mentioned in</hi> Zachary, <hi>were appointed vpon occaſsions of the affliction of the Church in</hi> Babilon, <hi>and ceaſed vpon their deliuerance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The Prophet in the ſame place hath plainely preuented this anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were: for he ſaith, <hi>That they then in the beginning of that captiuity,</hi>

                  <hi>had already faſted ſeauenty yeares:</hi> and addeth, <hi>That they ſhould continue thoſe faſtes, vntill the</hi> Gentils <hi>ſhould joyne with them in faith,</hi> vvhich vvas for foure hundreth yeares after. Adde herevnto, a faſt &amp; feaſt appointed at the inſtance of the moſt vertuous Queene <hi>Hester</hi> and good <hi>Mardocheus,</hi>

               <p>The third argument. Although in the newe Teſtament, there be no euident teſtimony for a ſet time of faſting (as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) yet there is ſome mention made of a ſet time of faſting:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Whereas nowe it was not ſafe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23774:44"/> ſayling, becauſe the faſt nowe was paſt.</hi> True it is, that ſome doe expound this of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſet faſt in the Moneth of <hi>September;</hi> but that expoſition is not ſo probable: for after that time of the yeare (eſpecially in thoſe hot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) it is very ſafe ſailing; and therefore, it cannot ſo wel be vnderſtood of that ſeaſon. Againe <hi>S. Luke</hi> wrote the acts of the Apoſtles, rather for the <hi>Gentils</hi> then for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he being a companion of the Doctor of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils:</hi> and therefore it is more probable, that he deſcribeth the ſet faſt of the Chriſtian <hi>Gentils,</hi> which was in the moneth of <hi>December,</hi> nowe called em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dayes, when ordinarily <hi>Prieſtes</hi> and other eccleſiaſticall perſons were conſecrated; as may be ſeeme in the pontiffical of <hi>Pope Damaſus,</hi> who liued one thouſand two hundreth yeares paſt.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This anſwere, firſt imployeth a notable errour, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are not bound in conſcience to obey their ciuill Magiſtrates lawes, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> expreſly condemneth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</note> ſaying: <hi>Therefore be ſubject of neceſsity, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake:</hi> Wherefore, the ciuill Magiſtrates commanding a ſet faſt, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt of neceſſity and for conſcience ſake obſerue it; or elſe, they commit the ſinne of diſobedience at the leaſt. But beſides this abſurdity, there is an other no leſſe, conteined in this anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were: For I doe aſke whether the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> lawe of ſet faſting be good and allowable or no? If good (as M. P. graunteth) then Chriſtians ſurely
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23774:44"/> are bound to keepe it; becauſe they are bound to obey their Gouernors in good matters: and conſequently, their liberty of eating may be abridged by their Superiors lawes, by their owne confeſſion: wherefore, they muſt either condemne their owne Magiſtrates lawes for nought worth; or elſe, whether they will or will not, allowe of ours. And that excuſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of endes, is not to purpoſe. For if the Magiſtrates may for a ciuill reſpect, reſtraine our liberty: much more may they doe it for a religious; which is of a higher nature, and more forcible to binde our conſciences.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſecond point of difference. Where M. P. findeth fault with two petty imperfections in the manner of our faſting, before he commeth to the greateſt, to wit: with <hi>the permiſsion to drinke water, wine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudic.</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>or electuaries vpon faſting daies; &amp; with the eating of one meale, at, or about noone-tide:</hi> which he diſproueth firſt, <hi>becauſe it is contrary to the practiſe of the old Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we anſwere: firſt, that there is no mention made at al, of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>wine</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> or of not drinking: wherefore, to that part, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And to ſpeake a word by the way, of drinking of wine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on faſting dayes; it was wholy forbidden in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Church, where the countries being exceeding hotte, water alone might be drunken without da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of health. In other countries ſomewhat colder, which haue no other drinke but wine and water, as it is in <hi>Spaine, Italy,</hi> and in that climate where <hi>Nauarra</hi> liued: there, wine is premitted on faſting daies, &amp; vſed in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon ſpecially; but yet, wel tempered with water. But in <hi>England</hi> and in other like places, where we haue beere: there to drinke much wine on faſting daies, is not tollerable. Touching the other point, <hi>of taking the meale about noone-tide,</hi> I grant that the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the two places cited by M. PER. did faſt till euening: but we are not bound to conforme our ſelues to that their faſting. Firſt, becauſe it was an extraordinary faſt, and ſo being but once vſed, might eaſier be borne for one day. Secondly, mens bodies were in thoſe daies ſtronger, &amp; better able to beare out a long faſt, then they are at theſe: and therefore, our diſcreet &amp; deare <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, condeſcending vnto the infirmity of her tender children, doth not exact more then they are wel able to performe, without danger of health. And therefore, albeit in the primatiue Church generally, when men were ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger both in ſpirit and body, the lawe &amp; cuſtome was to faſt, vntill three of the clocke in the after-noone: notwithſtanding, in theſe later daies, when men are growne weaker; the Church doth not exact any more of vs, then to faſt vntil noone, though ſhe like thoſe better, who (being wel able) doe faſt longer. Nowe to the maine point of difference of meates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Catholikes</hi> (ſaith Maſter PERKINS) <hi>allowe only white-meate on their faſting daies</hi> (yea, they allowe not ſo much neither in Lent, but only fiſh)
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23774:45"/> 
                  <hi>and that of neceſsity and for conſcience ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True. All <hi>Catholikes</hi> hold themſelues bound in conſcience, to obey the lawes of their Superiors in theſe caſes, if they be able; if not, to aſke leaue of their Paſtours, to eate that vvhich will ſerue their turne. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith M. PER. out of the preſumption of his owne wiſdome) <hi>we hold this diſtinction of meates to be both fooliſh and wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good wordes Sir (I pray you) for (be it ſpoken without your diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement) farre wiſer and better men then your ſelfe, haue beene and are of an other opinion. But he will proue his aſſertion ſo mightily, that no man ſhall be able to gaine-ſay it. Let vs heare him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, it is fooliſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe in ſuch meates as they preſcribe, there is as much filling and delight, as in fleſh: namely in fiſh, fruites, and wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howe proueth he this? Neither by reaſon, nor yet by any authority of either foole or phiſicion: and therefore we muſt needes take him for an odde wiſeman, that ſo lightly vpon his owne phantaſie only, durſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the conſtant opinion of all Chriſtians of many hundreth yeares for <hi>fooliſh and wicked.</hi> But, pleaſeth it you to vnderſtand (good Sir) that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were no difference in the meates; yet, the commandement of our Paſtours (being to refraine from the one, and not from the other) were ſufficient to make a diſtinction of meates, and to binde vs to abſtaine from them, without any touch of folly. For what difference for delight or filling, was there betweene the forbidden fruite of Paradiſe and other fruites? Yet, becauſe contrary to commandement, our firſt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> did eate thereof, they became both fooliſh &amp; wicked: therefore, it is no fooliſh part to obſerue a diſtinction of meates, vvhen it is ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by our Gouernours.</p>
               <p>To confute him more fully, let vs heare what reaſon our Paſtours had to preſcribe ſuch a diſtinction of meate, faſting being ſpecially inſtituted to bridle and ſubdue the vnlawfull deſires of the fleſh, it was moſt meete that we ſhould refraine from eating of fleſh on faſting dayes; becauſe that the eating of fleſh, doth more nouriſh and pamper vp our fleſh, then the eating of fiſh. For fleſh, both in it ſelfe is more nouriſhing, as being of a more warme ſubſtance and fuller of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uyce, then fiſh: and againe, it is more like vnto our ſubſtance, and ſo more apt to feed it; and conſequently, to make it (like a well fedde horſe) more proude and ready to reſiſt reaſon: and therefore, our Prelates had great cauſe to forbid eating of fleſh, when they would haue vs to tame our fleſh by faſting. If ſome dainty fiſh be more agreeable vnto ſome appetites, then ſome kinde of groſſe meate; that is not materiall: For in compariſons if they be equall, the beſt of the one muſt be compared with the beſt of the other, and not the worſt of one
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23774:45"/> ſort, with the beſt of the other. Now, ouermuch filling of our bellies with meate, as ouer charging of our heads with drinke, and hunting after dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cares; are, by the very light of nature condemned, and ſo there needed no newe inhibition againſt them: but the only thing that remained indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, was the diſtinction of meates; wherein the wiſdome of the Church hath greatly ſhewed her ſelfe: which, to make our faſt more agreable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the proper end of it (that is to tame the fleſh) hath enjoyned vs to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from fleſh. And this was obſerued and collected out of the practiſe of her moſt wiſe, holy, and Godly children. For the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> when he did faſt very deuoutly, abſtayned, as from all dainties;<note place="margin">

               <p>But, (ſaith M.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply. Daniels</hi> faſt was of his owne deuotion, and conſequently <hi>his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence</hi> from fleſh, free: but our ordinary faſts are by commandement, and therefore by obedience we are bound to abſtaine from fleſh. Nowe, we vſe the example of <hi>Daniell,</hi> not to proue that we are bound to faſt; but that on faſting dayes we ſhould for-goe the eating of fleſh, as he did.</p>
               <p>But M. PER. addeth: <hi>If we imitate</hi> Daniell <hi>in refraining from fleſh, why doe we not imitate him alſo in abſtaining from dainties and oyntements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere:</hi> They doe better that imitate him in one good point though they doe not in all; then they that followe him in none at all. Beſides, all curious dainties are forbidden, not only on faſting dayes, but at all times,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23774:47"/> both by the light of nature, and by our learned Paſtors: but becauſe that may be dainty to one, which is but ordinary and meete for another (their complexion and education conſidered) a certaine order could not be ſet for all ſortes of people, touching dainty meates: wherefore, they are left vnto the rule of reaſon for that point, and to the inſtruction of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours. Nowe we confeſſe with <hi>Molanus,</hi> that in ancient times, men were much more feruent in faſting then they be nowe a-dayes, becauſe the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of many is growne colde: but yet (God be thanked) there be many religious perſons and alſo others among vs, that doe an hundreth times more deuoutly faſt, then the <hi>Protestants</hi> vſe to doe; who making the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Chriſtians, the occaſion of fleſhly licentiouſneſſe, haue among their followers (wholy in manner) ruinated and rooted out all auſterity of life, and Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Nowe to the third and laſt part of our difference. <hi>Catholikes make ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence it ſelfe, in perſons fitly prepared; to be a part of the worſhipping of God: but we take it to be a thing indifferent in it ſelfe: but yet well vſed, to be a proppe or furtherance to the worſhippe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It grieueth me to ſee the doubling and deceite, that this Miniſter many times vſeth. Doe <hi>Catholikes</hi> make faſting of it ſelfe, vvithout his right end and all due circumſtances, a part of Gods vvorſhippe? if he ſay ſo (as his vvordes leade a man to beleeue) he belyeth vs ſhamefully. For vve hold that no worke, be it neuer ſo good in it ſelfe; yet, if it want either a good end, or any other due circumſtance, it is not good or pleaſing to God. The point then in difference is this, that vve eſteeme faſting duly performed, <hi>to be a part of Gods worſhippe,</hi> and to appeaſe vvrath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, to ſatisfie for the temporall puniſhment of our ſinnes; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to be meritorious: which I will in a word confirme here, referring him that deſireth to ſee more, vnto the ſeuerall Queſtions before handled, of Satisfaction, and Merits.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that vve by faſting and humbling of our ſelues before God, and puniſhing our bodyes there-by, for our former faultes doe appeaſe, and pacifie the vvrath of God, may be proued by many examples of the old Teſtament; but theſe two may ſerue the turne, which M. PERKINS toucheth. The firſt of the <hi>Niniuites, vpon whome God tooke mercy at the contemplation of their faſting, and other workes of penance:</hi> ſo ſaith the text; <hi>And God ſawe their workes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

PERKINS extrauagant gloſſe of <hi>Orleance</hi> (as they ſay) vvhich corrupteth ſo much the text; <hi>That the</hi> Niniuites (forſooth) <hi>laide hold on Gods mercy in Chriſt by faith.</hi> For that the <hi>Niniuites</hi> (being <hi>Gentils</hi>) had euer heard of Chriſt, or knewe the miſtery of his mediation, Maſter PERKINS vvill neuer be able to proue.</p>
               <p>The ſecond example is of King <hi>Achab,</hi> vvho being threatned vvith great puniſhment according to his deſerts, fearing the juſt judgements of God, did faſt and doe great penance: Whereupon, God delaide his puniſhment. And M. PERKINS doth greatly ouer-ſhoote himſelfe, in affirming that this his repentance <hi>was but hypocriſie;</hi> vvhen God himſelfe doth ſay to <hi>Elias:</hi>

PERKINS bluſheth not to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him, and giue him (as it vvere) the lie, ſaying; that <hi>it was but in hypocriſie:</hi> no meruaile if this man be bold with God his Church, that feareth not to controule God himſelfe.<note place="margin">Serm. de Lapſ.

               </p>
               <p>The third fruit of faſting is, to ſatisfie for the temporall puniſhment due vnto our ſinnes, after the remiſſion of the eternall: vvhich very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon perſwadeth, that they who haue offended God, by taking vnlawfull pleaſures of the fleſh, ſhould by ſuffering ſome bodily chaſtiſement, recompence for their former faultes.<note place="margin">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23774:48"/> confirmed by the example of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> and many others. But M.

               <p>Fourthly, faſting is very meritorious in Gods ſight, as Chriſt ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, when commanding vs to faſt (not vpon vaine glory as the <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> did, but to pleaſe his heauenly Father) he addeth the reward:<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe M. PERKINS here doth not deale vprightly, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of our conſents, putteth downe their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, farre diſſenting from ours, I will firſt out of him, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their opinion touching the perfection of man, and then declare ours; that vve may vvith more perſpicuity perceiue the difference.</p>
            <p>He in his firſt concluſion graunteth, <hi>That all true beleeuers haue a ſtate of true perfection in this life. Which perfection</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>conſiſteth in two partes: The former is, the imputation of Chriſtes perfect obedience vnto vs; The latter is, a certayne ſincerity and vprightneſſe, ſtanding in two thinges: The firſt, is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our owne imperfection; The ſecond, to haue a conſtant purpoſe, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and care to keepe not ſome fewe, but all and euery Commandement of the lawe of God. And this endeauour is a fruit of perfection, in that it proceedeth from the regenerate: For, as all men through</hi> Adams <hi>fall, haue in them by nature the ſeedes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:23774:49"/> of all ſinne, the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt not excepted: ſo by grace of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration through Chriſt, all the faithfull haue in them likewiſe, the ſeedes of all vertues neceſſary to ſaluation: and therevpon, they both can and doe endeauour to yeeld perfect obedience vnto God, according vnto the whole lawe; and ſo they may be tearmed perfect, as a child is called a perfect man: who though he want the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of age, ſtature, and reaſon; yet, he hath euery part and faculty both of body and ſoule, that is required to a perfect man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto M. PRR. In whoſe diſcourſe of perfection, I finde many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. For to omitte the imputatiue part of mans perfection (which I haue diſproued in the queſtion of juſtification.) Howe can it well hang together, that one and the ſame point of mans perfection (to wit: <hi>an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to keep all Gods commandements</hi>) is both an <hi>eſſentiall part of it;</hi> and yet <hi>but a fruite</hi> iſſuing out of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as M. PER. maketh it in expreſſe termes, and that within the compaſſe of fewe lines. For if this <hi>good andeauour, be but a fruite of perfection, proceeding from a man regenerate,</hi> as he ſaith in the later place: the ſurely the man regenerate vvas perfect before hee had that fruit; and ſo can it not be any ſubſtantiall part of perfection, as he before appointed it. Further, if he meane that the inward and inherent perfection of the regenerate, doth wholy conſiſt in <hi>the ſeeds of vertue;</hi> either he taketh <hi>the ſeedes</hi> very improperly for the corne, and perfect vertues themſelues: or elſe, he leaueth his perfect man (as the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philoſophers did a babe newly borne) like vnto a raſed paire of tables, altogither imperfect; hauing nothing written in them, but an aptneſſe only and capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue much, if it be by diligent endeauour afterward filled. But it is much to be wondered at, that he is become ſo exact a cenſor, as to require in his imperfect perfect man, <hi>A conſtant purpoſe; endeauour, and care to keepe not ſome fewe, but all and euery Commandement of the lawe of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his <hi>4.</hi> reaſon.</note> Hath he not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before; yea, doth he not in this very queſtion take it for certaine, that no regenerate man can fulfill the lawe? which if it were true, howe can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue a conſtant purpoſe to keepe it? For (as both Philoſophers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines doe teach in ſchoole, and very reaſon informeth euery one of meane vnderſtanding at home) no man vvell in his wits, can haue a full purpoſe and determination to doe that, vvhich he knovveth to be impoſſible for him to doe. Who euer endeauoured to leape ouer mountaines? or had a ſpeciall care to build Churches, not knowing any poſſible meanes to effect them? M. PERKINS then was very euill aduiſed to counſaile his regenerate man, to haue a conſtant purpoſe to endeauour, and care to keepe that, which he teacheth to be impoſſible for him to fulfill and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh. Novve to the doctrine of the <hi>Catholikes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We teach firſt, that a man baptiſed and in the ſtate of grace, hath in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:23774:50"/> him not the ſeedes only of all vertues both morall and diuine, neceſſary for his ſanctification, but the vertues themſelues, infuſed and powred in his ſoule, by the bountifull hand of God, through the merits of Chriſt <hi>Ieſus</hi> our redeemer, vvithout any deſert of ours: vvhereby man is made able vvith the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, to ouercome his owne euill paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to fulfill all Gods Commandements. And this kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vve hold, to be freely beſtowed vpon euery Chriſtian at his firſt juſtification, of vvhich I haue treated at large in that queſtion. A ſecond kinde of perfection there is, vvhich conſiſteth in the perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſubduing of all ſuch diſordinate affections; ſuch a complete mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of them I doe vnderſtand, as the frailty of our nature doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte in this life, vnto vvhich the beſt men (after long exerciſe of all kinde of vertue) doe attayne. Of neither of theſe two ſtates of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doe vve here entreate: but the preſent controuerſie is about a third kinde of perfection, vvhich is (as it vvere) placed betweene the other two, more perfect then the firſt, and not ſo perfect as the laſt: but it is a more ſpeedy and ready vvay to the later, and conſiſteth in the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h extraordinary vvorkes, that be not commanded of God, as neceſſary to ſaluation; but commended, as thinges of more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and left vnto our free choiſe vvhether vve vvill vndertake them or no. For example, God forbiddeth vs to commit adultery: but he doth not command vs to profeſſe virginity, and to liue alwaies a ſingle life; the vvhich yet he recommendeth, and exhorteth vs to embrace, ſaying:<note place="margin">Math. <hi>19.</hi> verſ. <hi>12.</hi> Ibidem. verſ. <hi>21.</hi>

               <hi>There be ſome that make themſelues</hi> Eunuches <hi>for the Kingdome of heauen;</hi> adding, <hi>He that can take it, let him take it:</hi> ſo he forbiddeth to ſteale; but counſaileth only <hi>to ſell all we haue, and to giue it to the poore and to followe him.</hi> Out of which and the like places of holy Scriptures we gather; that there be diuers bleſſed good vvorkes, vvhich are not commanded by any precept; yet, counſailed and perſwaded as thinges of greater perfection, which are alſo called workes of <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> by a name taken from theſe vvordes:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Quicquid ſupererogaueris,</hi> vvhere the good <hi>Samaritane</hi> told the Inne-Keeper, that whatſoeuer he ſhould lay out, ouer and beſides that vvhich he had giuen him, ſhould be repayed him at his retourne. Theſe vvorkes of perfection, and ſupererogation, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may not abide, in ſhewe (forſooth) of profound humility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that we can doe, is nothing in reſpect of that which we ought to doe: but (in deede) vpon enuy and malice towardes religious men and women; the luſtre and fame of whoſe ſinguler vertue, doth mightily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and diſgrace their fleſhly and baſe conuerſation, vvho commonly paſſe not the vulgar ſort in any other thing, but in tongue and habit.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:23774:50"/>
            <p>M. PERKINS in his ſecond concluſion, <hi>alloweth only vnto our Sauiour Chriſt, workes of ſupererogation, becauſe he alone fulfilled the lawe: wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his death was more then the lawe could require at his handes being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if I lifted to take aduantages as he offereth them, I could tell him, that although the lawe could exact nothing at Chriſtes handes, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and aboue the lawe; yet, al that euer Chriſt did was commanded him by his Father: and therefore by a certaine vncertaine rule of M. PER. (to wit, <hi>That no worke commanded: can be a worke of ſupererogation</hi>) he could not doe any worke of ſupererogation, being bound to doe all he did, by commandement of his heauenly Father, whome he was bound to obey.</p>
            <p>But to come to the point of our difference: we hold that there be many workes of perfection, vnto which no man is bound; neuertheleſſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall performe any of them, they ſhall haue a greater crowne of glory in heauen for their reward. M. PER. goeth about to diſproue it, by prouing <hi>that no man can fulfill the lawe of God in this life, much leſſe doe workes of ſupererogation.</hi> I ſay that he taketh not a direct courſe to improue our poſition. For albeit a man could not fulfil that law; yet, may he doe many of thoſe workes of perfection: for a man may lead a chaſte life; &amp; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in a paſſion fall out with his neighbour, and hurt him in word or deede, or ſweare, and ſo offend in choller: for this ſometime hapneth; and then the workes of perfection not commanded, being done by ſuch a one, may the ſooner purchaſe him pardon, and be great helpes to him, towardes the fulfilling of the lawe: wherefore, Maſter PERKINS erreth in the very foundation of his proofes; notwithſtanding we will heare his arguments, becauſe they ſerue to fortifie an other odde ſconce or bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of their hereſie, to wit: <hi>That it is impoſſible to keepe Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The firſt, he propoundeth in this ſort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the morall lawe two thinges are commanded: firſt, the loue of God and man; ſecondly, the manner of this loue. Nowe the manner of louing of God, is to loue him with all our hart and ſtrength:</hi> Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lucae</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27.</note> with all thy hart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy thoughts, &amp;c. <hi>As</hi> Bernard <hi>ſaid: The meaſure of louing God, is to loue him without meaſure; and that is, to loue him with the greateſt perfection of loue, that can befall a creature. Hence it followeth, that in louing God, no man can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſsibly doe more then the lawe requireth: and therefore, the performance of all vowes and of all other duties, come to ſhort of the intention and ſcope of the lawe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere. To loue God with all our hart, and ſtrength, &amp;c.</hi> may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in two ſorts. The firſt is to loue him ſo intirely, that we loue no other thing with him, in any ſuch degree, as may not well ſtand with his loue:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:23774:51"/> and alſo that in Gods ſeruice (when his honour ſhal ſo require) we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to imploy our vvhole ſtrength, hart, and life; and in this ſence euery good Chriſtian doth loue God, with all his hart, and may doe (beſides his bounden duty therein) many other good vvorkes: becauſe the precept being affirmatiue, doth not binde for all times; but only nowe and then, when occaſion ſo requireth. Secondly, the wordes may be taken to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that we ſhould alwayes (with all the powers of both body and minde, and that at the vttermoſt ſtraine) loue, honour, and ſerue God: and ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it is fulfilled in heauen, but cannot be performed on earth by any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall creature, with ordinary grace; becauſe we muſt ſleepe and eate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and doe many other thinges beſides, though not contrary to the ſame loue. In the firſt ſence we are commanded to loue God with all our hart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the ſecond, it is no commandement, but only a marke for vs to ayme and leuell at; but no man vnder ſinne is bound to attayne vnto it.</p>
            <p>To that of <hi>S. Bernard</hi> I anſwere, that to loue God as much as he is to be loued, is to loue him infinitly, which none can doe, but only God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. If he meane that we muſt loue God without meaſure: then he is to be vnderſtood, that in the loue of God, there be not (as in the matter of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues) two extreamities; too little and too much: only there may be too little, but there cannot be too much; yet, there is a certaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or degree, to which euery one is bound to attaine: whither, if he haue gotten, he loueth God with all his hart, as before hath beene declared. Now beyond that degree, the perfecter ſort of Chriſtians doe mount, and ſo much the more, by howe much they doe proceede in that perfection: yet, in this life they can neuer attaine to loue God, ſo feruently and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, but that they may alwaies encreaſe and loue him more and more; &amp; ſo there is not a prefixed meere-ſtone, or limit of louing God: in which ſence only, we may truly ſay; that God is to be loued without meaſure: but that is (as I ſaid before) rather a marke that vve ſhould ſhoote at, and the end of a commandement, then a thing commanded.</p>
            <p>M. PERKINS ſecond reaſon. <hi>The compaſſe of the lawe is large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth commandements, not only negatiue but alſo affirmatiue, and in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue be not only forbidden the capitall ſinnes, as murther, adultery, theft: but all ſinnes of the ſame kinde, with all their occaſions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And in the affirmatiue are commanded not only the contrary vertues, but all helpes and meanes, whereby the ſaid vertues may be preſerued: thus doth our Sauiour himſelfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>expound the lawe.</hi> Vpon which ground her concludeth, <hi>that all duties pertayning to life and manners; come within the liſt of ſome morall commandement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The Commandements are but tenne, and the expoſition

Nowe to ſay, <hi>That all duties of life appertayne vnto them,</hi> is both falſe, and not to the purpoſe: for firſt, it is moſt euident, that the vvhole matter of the Sacraments, and vvhatſoeuer elſe is proper vnto vs Chriſtians by the doctrine of the Goſpell, and not common vnto vs with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> is ouer and aboue the tenne Commandements. I ſaid alſo, that the anſwere is impertinent: for it proceedeth only in duties of life, and we treate here of ſuch points of perfection, which no man in duty is preſſed vnto; but only may followe of deuotion, for his aduancement in vertue and Gods fauour. The other reaſons following I haue anſwered in my former part, yet becauſe ſome will be vnwilling to be ſo often referred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another volume, I will here againe briefly anſwere them.</p>
            <p>M. PERKINS third reaſon.<note place="margin">

            <p>Can any man tell to what purpoſe this ſentence is cited here?

            </p>
            <p>What is this to the matter? doth Chriſt ſpeake of counſailes left to our liberty in that text, becauſe commandements be more excellent? vvhat a ſenceleſſe reply is this?

Chriſt ſaith not; <hi>When you haue done all that is commanded, you are vnprofitable ſeruants:</hi> but, <hi>then ſay, that you are vnprofitable ſeruants.</hi> That is: haue you then an humble opinion of your ſelues, and thinke rather vpon your owne imperfection, then of your vvell-doing; and if you finde all vvell, thanke him that gaue you the grace to performe it, and confeſſe that you haue done but your duty: and leaue it to your good neighbour, to praiſe you if he pleaſe; and to God to recompence you: ſo doth <hi>S. Chryſostome</hi> interpret this place. But Maſter PERKINS to preuent this anſwere, thought it pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to ſtrike that vvorde out of the text. O vvorthy cutter of Gods vvorde!</p>
            <p>His fourth reaſon is: <hi>That it is not in the power of man to keepe the lawe: much leſſe is he able to doe any worke that is beyond and aboue the lawe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The antecedent and conſequent are both falſe: that vve be able with the helpe of Gods grace, to keepe the lawe, is proued in a whole queſtion of the firſt part.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 78.</note> That we may doe ſome workes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation (albeit we fayled in ſome workes of the lawe) hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the beginning of this queſtion. For though one vvorke of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:23774:52"/> be harder to doe, then one worke of the lawe; yet, is it of more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to keepe thirty precepts of the lawe, then three counſailes: and againe, a man may be more diligent in obſeruing counſailes, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and ſo obſerue them better.</p>
            <p>Nowe to the arguments for the <hi>Catholike</hi> party. The firſt is taken out of the Prophet <hi>Eſay: Our Lord ſaith vnto</hi> Eunuches <hi>that keepe his</hi> Sabbaoth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 56. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>and chooſe the thing that pleaſeth him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He will giue them a place and a name, better then to the Sonnes and Daughters, an euerlaſting name that ſhall not periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence vve thus reaſon. Vnto <hi>Eunuches</hi> that chooſe the thing vvhich pleaſeth God (that is, make choiſe of a ſingle and chaſte life) God vvill giue more grace in this vvorld, and more glory in the next,<note place="margin">De Virg. cap. <hi>25. 1.</hi> Cor. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> alſo expoundeth it. Nowe, no man is bound by the lawe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe virginity, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> declareth: vvherefore, the obſeruation of virginity is of counſaile and ſupererogation, very pleaſing to God if it be performed: yet, not commanded. Maſter PERKINS anſwereth: <hi>That to ſuch</hi> Eunuches <hi>a greater rewarde is promiſed, not for profeſsion of their chastity, but becauſe they obſerued the Lordes</hi> Sabbaoth, <hi>and kept his couenant, which is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to beleeue the worde of God, and to obey his Commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This cannot be ſaid: for vnto thoſe <hi>Eunuches, A greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is promiſed then vnto other Sonnes and Daughters,</hi> that is: then to others of the faithfull. Nowe <hi>that greater</hi> muſt be due vnto them for ſome thing in them, which was not to be found in other of the faithfull; <hi>But to beleeue the word of God, and to obey his Commandements,</hi> is a thing common vnto all that are to be ſaued: therefore, it followeth neceſſarily, that for their chaſtity wherein they excelled others, they are preferred before others; which is confirmed by that place, where it is ſaid:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.</note>

                  <hi>Math.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>That there are ſome who haue made them-ſelues chaſte, for the Kingdome of Heauen; and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them that can take that courſe of life, to take it:</hi> therefore, the vowe of ſingle life is vvarrantable by the vvorde of God, and hath a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all promiſe of glory in heauen, and yet is not commanded: vvhence it euidently followeth, that there are vvorkes of counſaile, ouer and beſides the Commandements of God, left to the free choiſe of men.

            <p>Not all, but ſo much as out of which, the reſt neceſſarily followeth, to wit: that by profeſſion of chaſtity, as they doe more benefite the Church of God; ſo conſequently doe they more pleaſe God; and deſerue of him a greater reward: and that chaſtity being only counſailed and not enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by precept, it is a worke of ſupererogation and perfection.</p>

               </gap>, that he made gaines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, although he had ſparingly liued by it. Briefly, to auoide ſome ſuch let, as he was not in conſcience bound to auoide, becauſe it vvas not any ſcandall of the weake, which we are bound to auoide; but of the wicked and malitious, which may with good conſcience be contemned, as the other Apoſtles did (yet <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>OVr diſſent lyeth in the manner of worſhipping: the</hi> Papiſts <hi>make two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of religious worſhippe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe ſeeme not to vnderſtand the <hi>Catholike</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning the worſhipping of Saints, but out of their affected ignorance, doe eſteeme vs therefore Idolaters: I hold it expedient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the ſtate of this queſtion more particulerly.</p>
               <p>To beginne then with this word <hi>worſhippe:</hi> it doth ſignifie a knowledge or conceite of an other mans excellency, joyned with a reuerent reſpect to the ſame perſon, vvith ſome either inward or outward acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: ſo that all worſhippe is due and done vnto an other, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſome excellent quality, which we ſuppoſe to be in him.</p>
               <p>Nowe there being three moſt general kindes of excellency, there muſt alſo be three ſeuerall and diſtinct ſortes of worſhippe, correſpondent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p>The firſt and principall kinde of excellency, is infinit, and proper to God alone; who is almighty, infinitly wiſe and good, the only Creatour, ſupreame Gouernour, and finall end of heauen and earth, and of al thinges contayned in them: therefore, to him alone appertayneth infinit honour and glory, and that ſupreame worſhippe, which the <hi>Latins</hi> (vſing the <hi>Greeke</hi> word) call <hi>Latria</hi> Godly honour. Nowe to attribute or giue this ſoueraigne worſhippe vnto any other, then vnto God only, is Idolatry, the moſt haynous offence that can be.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of excellency, I make the meaneſt of all abſolute (for of reſpectiue excellency which is in Images, and ſuch like holy thinges, I haue ſpoken in that Chapter) and that is to be found only in creatures, indued with reaſon and vnderſtanding, in regard of ſome rare quality and endowment, wherein they excell and ſurpaſſe others; ſo that that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertue and quality, doe proceede only out of the naturall faculty and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23774:55"/> perfection of the party; and doe not ſpring from any ſupernaturall gift: therefore, within the compaſſe of this ſort of excellency, I comprehend all natural perfections, either of Men or Angels; becauſe all ſuch iſſue out of one generall fountayne, of a nature indued with reaſon: and to this kinde of excellency is due, a morall or ciuill obeyſance or worſhippe.</p>
               <p>There is a third kinde of excellency ſeated betweene the two former extreames, farre ſurpaſſing the naturall perfection of any pure creature; and yet infinitly leſſer then the diuine Majeſty of God, which conſiſteth in the perfection of Faith, Hope, Charity, Religion, and other ſuch like gifts of the holy Ghoſt. And to this kinde of excellency, is due a different manner of worſhippe, which the <hi>Latins</hi> for diſtinction ſake doe call <hi>Dulia.</hi> Note that I ſay for diſtinction ſake: for both the wordes <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Dulia;</hi> if they be taken in their firſt natiue ſignification, may be giuen vnto any kinde of worſhip due to God or Man: yet, to auoide confuſion; the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diuines haue appropriated <hi>Latria</hi> vnto the worſhippe of God; and <hi>Dulia,</hi> to ſignifie the honour due to Saints or Angels, in regard of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall perfections.</p>
               <p>To come nowe vnto the firſt point of our difference. The <hi>Protestants</hi> doe commonly confound theſe two later kindes of vvorſhippe, and doe make but one of both the ciuill and ſupernaturall; that they may ſkippe from the one of them to the other, when they be driuen vnto their ſhifts: and yet nothing is more cleare, then that they be as diſtinct and different the one from the other, as the grace of God is, from the nature of a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature. For as morall and ciuill worſhippe only, is due vnto that excellency vvhich ariſeth out of the naturall power of man, not aſſiſted with any extraordinary grace of God (ſuch as was in the old <hi>Heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who for their valiant proweſſe, and politike gouerment deſerued to be honoured &amp; worſhipped:) euen ſo the fortitude of Chriſtian Martir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe (I ſay) and the like diuine prerogatiues, cannot but deſerue a farre more excellent kinde of honour and worſhippe, then the former; as they are more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and heauenly qualities, ſpringing from a more excellent roote of the grace of God: vvhich ſurpaſſeth in degree of excellency, the nature of Angels without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, who are but Gods ſeruants by nature, though of greater perfection then we. By grace they were made adopted ſonnes of God, <hi>and partakers of the diuine nature,</hi> as <hi>S. Peter</hi> citeth it;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi>

All which conuinceth, that there is in godly and holy perſonages, another kinde of excellency aboue naturall reach, to which is due a ſupernaturall reuerence and worſhippe, diſtinct from Ciuill: the which ſpirituall and ſupernaturall worſhip we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>religious;</hi> becauſe it is giuen vnto holy men or Saints, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their religious vertues, of faith, charity, fortitude in defence of religion, and of Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiority. The tearme of <hi>religious</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> vtterly miſlike, pretending that all kinde of <hi>religious</hi> worſhip is due vnto God only: but better men and greater clearkes then they by many degrees, doe vſe it in the very ſame ſence; as may be ſeene in diuers of <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> workes.<note place="margin">L. <hi>20.</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Fauſtum cap. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> Let this one ſentence ſuffice, where he ſaith: <hi>That Chriſtian people doe celebrate the memories of Martirs, with religious ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> True it is, that <hi>religious</hi> worſhip is ſometime (by the ſaid holy father and others) taken more ſtrictly, for the principall acts of religion, which are proper vnto God alone; and in that ſence we deny it to be giuen vnto any creature: but the ſame word is alſo (not ſeldome) vſed by them in a more large ſignification, and applied vnto all thinges that belong to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So we call <hi>religious men,</hi> ſuch as are ſpecially choſen to ſerue God: <hi>religious houſes,</hi> places where God is ſerued: <hi>religious vertues,</hi> ſuch as iſſue out of the roote of religion; and conſequently <hi>religious</hi> honour or worſhip, that is exhibited vnto men for their excellency in religious qualities, and religious affaires. So that any indifferent man (who delighteth not to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill vpon wordes) vnderſtanding our meaning to be very farre off from attributing any iote of Gods honour, vnto any Saint or any other thing whatſoeuer: cannot be juſtly offended with our tearmes of <hi>religious</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe giuen to Saintes; when as he is before-hand giuen to vnderſtand, that we take <hi>religious</hi> to ſignifie, not that which is proper to God: but thoſe religious gifts which be in godly men.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo it followeth moſt perſpicuouſly what intollerable wrong they doe vs, that call vs <hi>Idolaters;</hi> or ſay, that we robbe God of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and giue it vnto Saintes. For vve ſay, and repeate it a thouſand times ouer and ouer, and declare it as plainely as can be, that it is the moſt haynous crime in the vvorld, to giue any ſuch ſoueraigne honour, as is due to God only, vnto eyther Angels or Saintes, to vvit: to eſteeme them to be infinitly mighty, vviſe, or good; or to bee the Creatours or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:23774:56"/> ſupreame Gouernours of heauen and earth; or briefly, to be the authors of any ſupernaturall or naturall excellency or perfection. Theſe and ſuch like pointes of Diuine honour, we aſcribe not to any creature: but ſay, that the Saintes are Gods creatures and ſeruants, and doe receiue all that they eyther be or haue, or Gods liberallity; yet we hold it not to derogate any whit from the due honour we owe vnto God, to yeeld ſuch honour and worſhip vnto his Saints and ſeruants, as he hath made them worthy of. Nay rather, we doe not a litle honour God himſelfe, when we worſhip Godly men, for his diuine gifts beſtowed vpon them; and vvhen vvee thinke, that (becauſe they haue faithfully ſerued him on earth) they are nowe in heauen in high fauour with him; and can ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner obtaine any reaſonable ſuite of him, then other mortall men, vvho are ſubject to many infirmities. Neyther doe wee diminiſh any thing at all Chriſt our Sauiours mediation, by making the Saintes our interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. For (as ſhall bee hereafter declared at large) we attribute no point of Chriſtes mediation to them; but only range and place the Saints interceſſion, with the prayers of other good men liuing on earth, and vvith our owne, although in a different degree of perfection; theirs being farre better then ours: yet, all are made in Chriſtes name, and are effectuall through the merits of his Paſſion.</p>
               <p>But one may here object, howe then doe <hi>Catholikes</hi> affirme and ſay, that the Saints are <hi>their hope, and refuge,</hi> and howe can they deſire them, <hi>To haue mercy vpon them,</hi> and <hi>to helpe them;</hi> vvhich ſeeme to be thinges proper to God alone, and to Chriſt our redeemer? I anſwere firſt, that theſe ſpeeches in good ſence haue beene vſed by moſt auncient, learned, and circumſpect Authours, and that by imitation of the holie Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. For holy <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith: <hi>Haue mercy on me, haue mercy on me,</hi>

                  <hi>at least you my friendes.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the <hi>Theſſalonians, His hope, his joy, and crowne of glory;</hi> and deſireth the <hi>Romans</hi> to <hi>helpe him</hi> in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians that he became all thinges to all men, that he might ſaue all;</hi> vvith diuers ſuch like. So that no diſcreet man ought to condemne ſuch ſpeeches to the Saints, if they bee vttered vvith a good meaning, to vvit: that they taking compaſſion of our frailty and miſery, doe by their gratious interceſſion helpe to procure our pardon, and to obtayne at Gods bounteous handes, through the merit of Chriſtes paſſion, all ſuch heauenly graces as vve ſtand neede of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Albeit (as I haue ſayed) ſuch tearmes haue been very vvell vſed in all antiquity; yet, in theſe our captious dayes I could vviſh, that <hi>Catholikes</hi> vvould vſe them very ſparingly, for feare of ſcandalizing the poore deceaued <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:23774:57"/>
               <p>Obſerue laſtly, that by the outward manner and externall ſhewe of worſhippe, it cannot be ſufficiently diſcerned, whether it be Diuine, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, or Ciuill: for as we kneele to God, ſo doe we alſo on our knee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 24. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.</note> and his Councell; <hi>As</hi> Dauid <hi>did adore King</hi> Saul <hi>proſtrate on the earth.</hi> But the difference conſiſteth chiefly in the inward conceite, and diſpoſition of the minde; and ſo whether we kneele or no (if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our harts before God, inclining it vnto him, as to the Authour of all thinges, infinitly perfect) we doe him Godly honour. So, if we kneele to any Saints, or before any picture of a Saint in honour of the Saint, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging in our harts the Saint to be a very holy creature, indued with many great graces of God, and dearely beloued of him; we doe but duly worſhippe the Saint: as kneeling to the King, and in our harts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing him to be the ſupreame Gouernour vnder God of the temporall ſtate of his Kingdome, vve doe but our duties vnto our King. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it is not the outward faſhion of worſhippe, that maketh it proper to God or Man; when as kneeling to one, may be alſo in diriſion of him, as when <hi>Pilates</hi> ſouldiers kneeled to Chriſt: but the inward conceite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the judgement and hart. And therefore, they are very ſimple that reprehend <hi>Catholikes</hi> of Idolatry for kneeling before pictures; when as they kneele not to the picture it ſelfe, no more then <hi>Proteſtants</hi> kneele vnto that part of their ſeate, or to the wall that is before them: but they doe kneele to God, as to their ſoueraigne Lord; and to the Saint as to an holy perſonage, whoſe prayer to God for them they humbly requeſt.</p>
               <p>Nowe to the maine point in controuerſie, M. PER. denyeth: <hi>That any ciuill worſhippe in bending of the knee, or proſtrating of the body, is to be giuen to either Saints or Angels; and much leſſe any religious worſhippe, as namely inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſignified by any bodily adoration: for that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the honour of God himſelfe, by what name ſoeuer you call it.</hi> And this is all he ſaith (for ought I can ſee) touching the worſhipping of Saints.</p>
               <p>We on the other ſide ſay, that vve may both bend the knee, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the body to any Angell or Saint in heauen, and with a religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and obeyſance of our harts worſhippe them, for their excellent ſupernaturall gifts: and that this kinde of worſhippe, is much inferior vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the honour proper to God; yea, that it is infinitly leſſe, then that as hath beene already declared. M. PER. hath one only ſhadowe of a reaſon, why we muſt not yeeld any ciuill worſhip vnto the Saints: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they be abſent from vs, and we vſe not to worſhippe men that be abſent.</hi> ergo. Which is moſt eaſily confuted, and that two wayes. Firſt, if we ſay (as vve vvill proue afterward) that though they be farre diſtant from vs in place; yet, they ſee and knowe all the honour that vve preſent to them,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23774:57"/> and ſo are they morally preſent, and as ſo preſent may be vvorſhipped. Secondly, that we may truly honor them who are abſent corporally, by lifting vp our harts to them; and ſo repreſenting them to our mindes, may reuerence and vvorſhip them as ſpiritually preſent, according to that of S. Paul; <hi>I abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit:</hi> otherwiſe,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</note> vve Chriſtians ſhould not vvhiles we liued on earth, adore the humanity of our Sauiour Chriſt IESVS, becauſe he touching his humanity, is abſent from vs; which were moſt abſurd: and ſo is therefore M. PERKINS reaſon, out of vvhich it would neceſſarily followe. And becauſe M. PER. confoundeth this point of worſhipping of Saints with that of inuocation, and hudleth them together, nowe talking of the one, then of the other, beſides al good methode and order, and conſequently maketh two Chapters of the ſame matter: I will here in this former Chapter only treate of the worſhipping of Saints, drawing what M. PERKINS ſaith of this ſubject into this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, and referre the matter to inuocation vnto the next.</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon then againſt worſhipping of Saints, may be that which maketh the third in the 14. Chapter: <hi>Chriſt refuſed ſo much as to bowe the knee vnto Satan, vpon this ground: becauſe it is written, thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerue.</hi>

                  <hi>It may be demanded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>howe it is written thou ſhalt adore thy Lord God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerue; when as</hi> Abraham <hi>did ſo honour that kinde of people, that he did adore them? but we must obſerue that in the ſame Commandement, it is not ſaid, thou ſhalt only adore thy Lord thy God; as it is ſaid, him only ſhalt thou ſerue, which in</hi> Greeke is <hi>Latréysis, for ſuch ſeruice is due to God only.</hi> So that in briefe this moſt learned Father anſwereth our <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice proper to God (called <hi>Latria</hi>) is to be giuen to none but to God: Marry, that vvorſhip and adoration expreſſed in the former part of that ſentence, may be giuen to others, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> gaue it very well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people of <hi>Heth.</hi> Nowe, our Sauiour had great reaſon, not to yeeld ſo much as one jote of that meaner worſhip to Satan; becauſe he excelled him in nothing; but ſmall reaſon haue our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to reaſon thus (as in effect M. PER. doth:) Chriſt would not vvorſhip the Deuill, therefore Chriſtians may not worſhip Saints, as though Saints were no more to be worſhipped then the Deuill: a holy compariſon and vvell worthy a hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound.

               <p>That religious honour is due vnto them, is moſt cleare to all that know vvhy honour is due vnto any man. If honour be due vnto Nobility of birth, as it is commonly holden; the Saints are the Sonnes of God, <hi>the most honourable Lord of heauen and earth.</hi> If to be admitted to be one of a Kinges priuy Councell, maketh a man honourable; then the Saints are honourable,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27.</note>

Briefly, if excellent vviſdome, ſingular valour, and ſuch like heroycall vertues, make men honourable, as all men confeſſe; then are the Saints in heauen moſt honourable, vvho
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23774:59"/> ſo farre exceeded in all ſuch heroycall vertues of which the Philoſophers vvrite, all others as farre as heauen ſurpaſſeth the earth: ſo that it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth moſt euident, that the Saints are to be worſhipped. And as their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertues doe proceede from a more noble fountayne, then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man (to wit) from the grace of God, and doth therefore without compariſon, furmount all morall and ciuill either vertue or dignity: ſo are they with a more ſpirituall and religious kinde of worſhip to be vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and reuerenced. It may be ſaid, that albeit the Saints be ſo very honourable: yet, becauſe they be of another region they are not to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by vs, that be ſtrangers and foraigners to them: but this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>S.

Yea, for the deare and mutuall affection, vvhich is or ſhould be betweene theſe two partes of the ſaid Church, <hi>S. Paul</hi> calleth that <hi>Hieruſalem which is aboue our Mother:</hi>

               <p>Nowe to another taken from example, which alone is more then ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſettle any good Chriſtian in the faith of this point, thus it may be propounded: Both <hi>Iewes, Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Heretikes</hi> (that is, all ſortes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and misbeleeuing men) did finde great fault with the auncient true Chriſtians for worſhipping of Saints and their Relikes, and called it Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe nowe a-dayes: Contrarywiſe, the beſt and moſt learned Doctors in that pure antiquity, did maintayne and defend vvorſhipping of Saints and their Relikes, teaching juſt as the <hi>Catholikes</hi> nowe doe: that they did indeede honour the Saints vvith great honour, but did not adore them, or giue the honour proper to God to any other then to God alone; let vs heare ſome proofe of this.

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.</note> as it is very often in holy Scripture: <hi>Our Lord knoweth the way of the juſt.</hi> Item, Chriſt vvill anſwere to them that were workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I knowe yee not;</hi> as alſo to the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>I knowe yee not,</hi> that is, I like you not: euen ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> could not then knowe, that is, approue the doing of thoſe their wicked and degenerate children. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly vve anſwere, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and the holy Patriarkes vvere (vntill Chriſt had by his paſſion paide their ranſome) not yet in the poſſeſſion of heauenly joyes; but detayned in a place of reſt, by the learned common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Lymbus Patrum.</hi> To this ſecond anſwere M. PER. replyeth: <hi>If they ſay that</hi> Abraham <hi>was in</hi> Lymbo <hi>(which they will haue to be a part of hell) what joy could</hi> Lazarus <hi>haue in</hi> Abrahams <hi>boſome? and with what comfort could</hi> Iacob <hi>ſay on his death bedde: O Lord I haue wayted for thy ſaluation?</hi> We rejoyne, that albeit <hi>Lymbo</hi> be thought to be vnder the earth; yet is it as farre remote from hell, as the depth of the earth will giue it leaue: for the place of Purgatory is betweene hell and it. Further, that in <hi>Lymbo</hi> there was no payne, but a quiet expectation of their deliuerance from thence,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23774:61"/> and tranſlation into heauen; vvhich brought them great joy: beſides, the good company of many millions of holy ſoules, that there attended the ſame happy houre of their deliuerance; of all vvhich <hi>Lazarus</hi> vvas partaker being carryed into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. I vvill here omit, that M. PER. in this very queſtion, maketh this matter of <hi>Lazarus</hi> but a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thereby not fit to confirme any point of doctrine in his owne judgement. To the ſecond place I ſay, that <hi>Iacob</hi> might haue great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thinke vpon his ſaluation, vvhich ſhould be accompliſhed in Chriſts time: for <hi>Abraham</hi> who was father of them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 56. 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>rejoyced to ſee Chriſts dayes, which he ſawe, and was glad,</hi> as our Sauiour himſelfe teſtifieth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: <hi>Huldah the Propheteſſe telleth</hi> Ioſias, <hi>that he muſt be gathered to his fathers, and put in his graue in peace, that his eyes might not ſee all the euill, which God would bring on that place. Therefore, the Saints departed ſee not the ſtate of the Church on earth: this concluſion</hi> Auguſtine <hi>confirmeth at large.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this vve anſwere; firſt, that the Propheteſſe (when ſhee ſaith, <hi>he ſhould not ſee the euill of that place</hi>) meaneth no more, then that he ſhould be after his death in ſuch a place of reſt and contentment, that it ſhould not grieue and vexe him to ſee the juſt puniſhment of his owne Country. Secondly, it may be ſaid of <hi>Ioſias</hi> who dyed long before Chriſt, as it is of <hi>Abraham;</hi> that he vvas to remayne in <hi>Lymbo</hi> vvhen that euill ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and ſo ſhould not ſee it. <hi>But Augustine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth confirme this concluſion at large.</hi> VVhy did not the honeſt man quote the place of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> as he is wont to doe? was it becauſe it would leade vs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the diſcouery of his deceit? <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> (indeede) doth very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly handle the queſtion, <hi>what knowledge ſoules departed haue;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De cura pro mort. ca. <hi>15. 16.</hi>
                  </note> and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: <hi>that ſoules departed, of their owne naturall knowledge doe not vnderſtand what is done by their friendes here; but that either by the report of other ſoules that come to them, or of Angels that goe betweene; or elſe by the reuelation of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God (in whoſe preſence Saints departed doe continually ſtand) they may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knowe, that which is here done:</hi> and thus much of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in this place, afterward you ſhall heare more of him concerning his opinion of the knowledge that Saints haue of our affaires.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon of M. PERKINS: <hi>No Creature, Saint, or Angell, can be a Mediatour for vs to God, ſauing Christ alone: for in a true Mediatour there muſt be three thinges. Firſt, that the word of God muſt reueale and propound him vnto the Church.</hi> Surely I ſhould thinke that he muſt firſt be a perfect Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, before he be propounded for ſuch a one. <hi>Secondly, a Mediatour muſt be perfectly just, ſo as no ſinne be found in him at all.</hi> Such be all Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <hi>Thirdly, a Mediatour must be a propitiator, that is: he muſt bring to God
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23774:62"/> ſome thing, that may appeaſe and ſatisfie his wrath for our ſinnes:</hi> ſo did <hi>Moyſes</hi> vvhen he appeaſed Gods wrath, juſtly kindled againſt the ſinnes of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſſe: thus might a man quickly anſwere M. PER. argument of his Mediatour.</p>
               <p>But to explicate this matter more clearely and particularly, I ſay that a Mediatour may be taken two waies. Firſt, he may be called a Mediatour, that doth in any ſort imploy himſelf betweene two parties to agree them; vvhether it be by perſwaſion or intreaty; vvhether by letter or word of mouth: and ſo is it commonly taken, and that according vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification of the word. Secondly, a Mediatour may be taken in an other ſence, not for euery one that vſeth meanes of attonement; but for him only that to make the agreement betweene the parties, is content to pay the debt himſelfe, and to ſatisfie for al other damages and detrimentes: and in this ſence doth <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſay;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That we haue one Mediatour the man</hi> IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS <hi>Chriſt, who gaue himſelfe a redemption for all.</hi> Note the latter vvordes, and you ſhall ſee this my diſtinction of Mediatour to be gathered out of the Apoſtles owne wordes: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we haue one Mediatour, that gaue himſelfe a redemption for all,</hi> that is, that tooke the debts of all our ſinnes vpon his owne ſhoulders, and ſatisfied fully for all: ſee here expreſſed the ſecond kinde of Mediatour. Nowe in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>he deſireth that interceſſions and prayers be made of the Chriſtians for all men, yea for</hi> Heathen <hi>Princes:</hi> behold the firſt kinde of Mediatour. For Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that pray for all men, by their interceſſion are meanes vnto God for conuerſion of others, and ſo may be called Mediatours in a good ſence; as <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſaith of himſelfe:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I was an interceſſour and meanes, or mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our Lord and you.</hi> And by <hi>S. Paul</hi> he is plainely called <hi>a Mediatour: the law was ordayned by Angels, in the hand of a Mediatour.</hi> And by <hi>S. Stephen</hi> he is called <hi>a Redeemer:</hi> as <hi>Othoniel</hi> is tearmed <hi>a Sauiour.</hi> And that in this ſence there may be many mediatours <hi>S. Cyril</hi> teſtifieth, ſaying:<note n="*" place="margin">In Ioh. l. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of God and man is</hi> IESVS <hi>Christ, not only becauſe he reconciled men vnto God; but for that he is naturally both God and man in one perſon. For by this meanes God reconciled our natures to him; for otherwiſe howe ſhould</hi> S. Paul <hi>haue ſaid, Christ to be the only Mediatour: for many of the Saints haue vſed the miniſtery of mediation; as</hi> S Paul <hi>himſelfe, crying vpon men to be reconciled to God: and</hi> Moyſes <hi>was a Mediatour; for he miniſtred the lawe vnto the people: and</hi> Ieremy <hi>was alſo a Mediatour, when he ſtood before God and prayed for good thinges to the people.</hi>

                     </gap> magnum apparuit in coelo.</note> when he taught that <hi>we ſtand in neede of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, to the Mediatour: and no one more for our profit and commodity, then the bleſſed Virgin Mary;</hi> ſo that this mediation and interceſſion of Saints, is no whit at all injurious vnto the only mediation of Chriſt: for it is of a farre different kind from Chriſtes mediation, and of the ſame ſort as the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be of other good men liuing on earth, who all ſue vnto God in Chriſts name, and hope to obtayne (all and euery of them) their petitions, by the vertue of his merits; and therefore all our prayers and theirs, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly concluded thus: <hi>Through our Lord</hi> IESVS <hi>Christ thy Sonne, who with thee liueth and raigneth in the vnity of the holy Ghoſt, God, for euer and euer.</hi> And thus much to M. PER. foundation laide vpon the ſandes, vvherein he ſo inſolently renounced the <hi>Catholike</hi> doctrine: but that I doe him no wrong, I muſt here adde a coople of other arguments which he miſplaced in the former queſtion, and therefore I reſerued them to this.</p>
               <p>The former. <hi>All true inuocation and prayer, made according vnto the will of God, muſt haue a double foundation: a commandement, and a promiſe. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to moue vs to pray: and a promiſe to aſſure vs that we ſhall be heard: for euery prayer muſt be made in faith; and without a commandement, and promiſe there is no faith. Vpon this infallible ground I conclude, that we may not pray to Saints departed: for in the Scripture there is no word either commanding vs to pray to them, or aſſuring vs that we ſhall be heard when we pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> We deny that prayer requireth that double foundation of <hi>a commandement to pray, and promiſe to be heard when we pray:</hi> and that vpon the vvarrant of ſome of the beſt prayers, that are recorded in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. When <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed for the ſauing of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.</note> and did obtayne that if there had beene in them but tenne juſt perſons, their Cyties ſhould not haue beene deſtroyed: we reade neither of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement giuen to <hi>Abraham</hi> to make that prayer, nor any promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beganne it, to be heard; and this man was the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and knewe much better then an hundreth M. PERKINS, howe and when to pray.</p>
               <p>And vvhen milde <hi>Moyſes</hi> that moſt vviſe conductor of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> prayed vnto God ſo peremptorily, <hi>that he would either blot him out of the booke of life, or elſe pardon his people the Iſraelites,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This mans eies-ſight beginneth to faile him much, that cannot diſcerne betweene <hi>calling vpon, and ſeruing;</hi> when many a Maſter calleth vpon his man whome he doth not ſerue, but is ſerued by him. The text is already expounded out of <hi>S. Auguſtine:</hi> that we muſt ſerue God only with God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, as the <hi>Greeke</hi> vvordes <hi>Latréyseis</hi> doth there notifie; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which only ſeruice, euery ſeruant (I hope) may ſerue his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and euery inferiour vvorſhip his ſuperiour: and ſo may we doe the Saints our betters in all goodneſſe, with ſuch worſhip as is due vnto their ſingular gifts. And as we may pray vnto men aliue vvithout derogation vnto God his only ſeruice: ſo may we doe to the Saints departed.</p>
               <p>But M. PER. fearing the weakeneſſe of this fortification, ſecondeth it with an other out of the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Howe ſhall we call vpon him in whome we haue not beleeued? but we may not beleeue in Saints, therefore we may not call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere, that we cannot call vpon any man for more then we beleeue to be in him; and ſo much muſt we beleeue to be in euery man, as we will demand at his handes. We call vpon Chriſt for ſaluation, and therefore muſt we firſt beleeue him to be a Sauiour: we call vpon Saints to pray for vs; therefore muſt vve before hand beleeue, that they both can and will pray for vs, and that they are able (through the fauour and loue that God beareth them) to entreate much at Gods handes: ſee howe vve muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in them, vpon whom we call for helpe.

                  <hi>The people beleeued God, and his ſeruant Moyſes.</hi> M. PERKINS goeth on, patching vp his former argument with that, which hath ſmall
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23774:63"/> coherence with it, to wit: <hi>That we haue no promiſe to be heard, but for Christs ſake.</hi> Admit it vvere ſo, it maketh nothing againſt prayer to Saints: for they pray for vs in Chriſts name, and are heard <hi>for Chriſts ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, M.

First, the doctrine of faith and piety to be confirmed. Secondly, prayer to God that ſome thing may be done for the ratifying of the ſaid doctrine. Thirdly, the manifeſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church by the two former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What of all this good Sir? Marry thinke what you vvill, for he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing; I will therefore apply all this to the purpoſe, and ſay firſt: That vvhen a miracle is graunted by God, to confirme any point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in controuerſie, then euery man is as vvell bound to beleeue that point of doctrine, as if it were plainely recorded in the holy Scripture; for it hath God to witneſſe, who cannot deceiue. Secondly, that <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> (a moſt Godly man, and one whoſe teſtimony M. PER. doth very often alleage) did fulfill all thoſe three worthy obſeruations of M. PER. in working of miracles to confirme inuocation of Saints; and therefore it is to be beleeued of all men, euen by M. PERKINS owne ſentence. For firſt he propounded inuocation of Saints,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:23774:64"/> which he ſaith to be drawne out of thoſe wordes of that parable, as I will proue when it ſhall be neede.

What our other groundes be for inuocation of Saints, ſhall be declared in our arguments following.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS fift reaſon. <hi>To pray to Saints departed, to bowe the knee to them while they are in heauen, is to aſſcribe vnto them, that which is proper to God: namely to knowe the hart and inward deſires thereof, and to knowe the ſpeeches and behauiours of all men, in all places on the earth at all times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> This man doth too too broadly enlarge his lies; for neither doe all men at once (much leſſe at all times) pray vnto euery or any one of the Saints: but ſuppoſe they did; yet, to heare all their prayers togither, is nothing ſo much as to ſee that which euery Saint doth ſee in heauen, to wit, the one only ſubſtance of God in three perſons: for what are all the cogitations of men, compared vnto the immenſe and incomprehenſible nature of God? not ſo much as the point of a pinne to the whole globe of the earth, and yet euery Saint in heauen doth clearely behold God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more able are they to heare and ſee all thinges that belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men. And as the learned Diuines knowe, the man-hood of our Sauiour Chriſt doth ſee, knowe, and comprehend all the deedes, wordes, and thoughts of all men, that haue liued ſince the beginning of the world, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end; becauſe it belongeth vnto him who is judge of all, to knowe all; aſwell to reward the good, as to puniſh the euill: and yet doth no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſay, that the man-hood of Chriſt is God, or equall vnto God in knowledge. Nowe, the Saints in heauen doe not ſee the ſecretes of our harts, in our harts; but being preſent to the face of God, doe behold in it (as it were in a moſt cleare glaſſe) all that is pleaſeth the goodneſſe of God to reueale vnto them: and it is incident, and belonging neceſſarily vnto their moſt happy eſtate, to haue graunted to them, all that in reaſon they can demande; otherwiſe they were not ſo happy as they might be. Now, what good nature would not be glad, to pleaſure his owne fellowe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and deare friendes; ſpecially ſuch as craue ſo much at his handes? vvherefore, it cannot be denyed of any conſiderate man, but that God who ſatisfieth al their juſt requeſts doth ordinarily reueale vnto his deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued Saints, all the prayers that be made vnto them. Surely <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in moſt expreſſe tearmes declareth:<note place="margin">De cura pro mort. cap. <hi>15.</hi> &amp; <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That God can giue ſuch power vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Saints and Martirs, that they may be preſent in ſpirit at euery place through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, where there is any memory of them: or prayer made vnto them.</hi> He will not take vpon him to define, whether they be actually there preſent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23774:64"/> or no, or whether by the miniſtery of Angels they be relieued that ſeeke helpe by the interceſſion of Martirs: but maketh no queſtion but that they heare all prayers made by vvhoſoeuer to them, and obtayne very many of their requeſts. And as <hi>S. Gregory</hi> ſaith: <hi>What doe they not ſee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>12.</hi> Moral. cap. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>who ſee him that ſeeth all thinges; yea, contayneth all thinges within himſelfe?</hi> Yet M. PER. bluſheth not to ſay, <hi>that it is but a forgery of mans braine, to imagine that the God-head is ſuch a cleare glaſſe, repreſenting all thinges; becauſe it ſhould then followe, that the Angels who behold Gods face, ſhould be ignorant of nothing: but the Angels haue learned ſome thinges of the Church (as</hi> S. Paul <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth:) therefore they ſee not all thinges in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we anſwere, that in God all thinges are repreſented, and ſhine more brightly, then in their owne naturall places: yet, doth not God communicate and reueale all thinges vnto euery body there preſent; but his diuine nature in three perſons, Chriſt, God, and Man, with all other naturall and ordinary thinges, from the cope of heauen to the center of the earth, are ſeene of euery Cytizen of heauen, though with a different degree of clearenes: but of Gods counſels concerning the gouernement of the world, ſo much is only knowne vnto either Angell or Men, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth vnto their ſtate, and that when it belongeth vnto them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angels might well not knowe many thinges belonging to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church, vntill they ſawe it accompliſhed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might be ſaid to haue learned ſome ſuch thing of the Church. But as we haue ſaid before, it properly appertayneth vnto the ſtate of Saints in heauenly bliſſe, to knowe their friendes reaſonable requeſts made vnto them; or elſe their conditions ſhould not be ſo perfect, but that they might in equity require the bettering of it: and conſequently they could not be ſo throughly contented, as their eſtate of perfect felicity in heauen doth demande: and thus much of M. PER. reaſons. To which I will here adde one argument, commonly vſed by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though M. PER. (for the weakeneſſe of it perhaps) thought beſt to omit it: it is taken <hi>ab authoritate negatiuè,</hi> which Schollers knowe to be naught worth.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Christ ſaith, come yee vnto me all yee that labour and be burdened, and I will refreſh you;</hi> he ſaith not goe to the Saints, but come to me. I anſwere, neither doth he ſay, doe not goe to the Saints, and therefore here is nothing againſt vs. We goe to Chriſt for remiſſion of our ſinnes, <hi>which lye more heauy then a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of lead vpon our backes,</hi> and through our redeemers merits doe we craue pardon of them: but to moue more effectually this our redeemer, and God his father to haue pitty vpon vs, we humbly deſire the Saints (his beſt beloued ſeruants) to ſpeake a good vvord in our behalfe, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our ſelues vnvvorthy to obtayne any thing at Gods handes,

                  </note>The firſt is out of <hi>S. Auguſtine. Christian men commend each other in their prayers to God: And who prayeth for all, and for whome none prayeth, he is the one and true mediatour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere, theſe wordes be rather for vs, for approuing and confeſſing our Sauiour Chriſt to be the only mediatour of redemption, as we haue already declared; they teach that all Chriſtians may commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues each to others prayers: Nowe, the Saints departed be Chriſtians (I truſt) as good as we, or rather farre better; therefor all other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may very well (in <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> judgement) commend themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints holy prayers, becauſe each one may commend himſelfe to any others prayers. Concerning the word Mediatour, <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer attributeth it vnto any, ſauing only to our Sauiour, taking it alwaies in the ſecond ſignification aboue named, to which three thinges are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required, according to <hi>S. Auguſtine:</hi> firſt, that he pray for all, and that none pray for him; which property M. PER. toucheth, but miſquoteth the place: for it is in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>cont. Parmenianum.</hi> The ſecond proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the moſt neceſſary of all is, that he pay the full price and ranſome of all our ſinnes, and that his redemption may in equall ballance, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe the grieuouſneſſe of our ſinnes, which is taken out of diuers places of Scripture. The third which is the ground of al the reſt is, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour be both God and Man; that participating of both natures, he may be as it vvere a naturall middle or meanes to reconcile the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames; and ſo as Man, be able to ſuffer ſomething to appeaſe Gods wrath; and as God, to giue to that ſuffering of his man-hood, infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, making thereby Chriſts ſufferinges more then ſufficient to pay for the redemption of an hundred vvorldes if neede had beene. And theſe proprieties gathered out of<note n="c" place="margin">Lib. <hi>9.</hi> de ciuitate, cap. <hi>15.</hi> &amp; alibi.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> and other Fathers, will put downe M. PER. odde deuiſe of proprieties of a Mediatour; all which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23774:65"/> make nothing againſt the interceſſion of Saints, who be not in that ſence to be called mediatours, and yet ceaſe not to pray for vs: let vs then goe on.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS citeth ſecondly another ſentence out of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> where he bringeth in our Sauiour ſaying:<note place="margin">Tract. <hi>22.</hi> in Iohan.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt no whether to goe but to me, thou haſt no way to goe but by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwere. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> there alludeth vnto thoſe vvordes of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life:</hi> and ſaith, that for life and truth vve haue no other way to ſeeke vnto, but vnto Chriſt; vvho according vnto his diuinity, is truth and life vnto the vvorld. And in this high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of redemption and mediation, he was the only way vnto his Father: for neither the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by their morall vertues, nor <hi>Iewes</hi> by the power of their law, could without him leade them to God. All this is very good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but no whit more againſt praying to Saints, then againſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of vs one to anothers prayers, or vſing any other meanes of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as <hi>S.

               <p>M. PERKINS citeth alſo one ſentence out of <hi>S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> who hath vvritten thus: <hi>Thou haſt no neede of Patrones to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De perfect Euangel.</note> 
                  <hi>nor much running vp and downe to flatter and fawne vpon others; for though thou be alone and want a Patrone, and by thy ſelfe pray vnto God, thou ſhalt obtayne thy deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> It ſeemeth by his wordes, <hi>of running vp and downe,</hi> and <hi>flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of others,</hi> (vvhich Gods Saints vvill not endure) that he ſpeaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſeeking vnto vaine-glorious and euill mortall men, to be our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones to God, which were folly. But admit he meant the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; then let vs take his whole meaning, and not wreſt his wordes to any other ſence then he vvill allowe and like of: he doth then often inueigh both againſt certayne rich men (vvho hauing giuen ſome little almes to the poore, thought themſelues ſure of pardon of their ſinnes, and of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through the poore mens prayers, though they prayed not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;) and alſo againſt all ſuch ſluggiſh lazie perſons, as relyed wholy vpon the interceſſion of Saints, not praying much for themſelues: vpon ſuch as theſe doth <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> often call to pray for themſelues, and not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:23774:66"/> to truſt wholy vnto the prayers of others; perſwading them, that it were better to pray for themſelues vvithout Patrones, then leauing all to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons not to pray themſelues at all. But the beſt of all to be, both to pray themſelues, and to imploy alſo good men and the Saints to pray for them; this is his owne declaration in theſe his wordes:<note place="margin">Homil. <hi>5.</hi> in Math.</note> 
                  <hi>Let vs not like ſluggards and ſlouthfull companions, depend wholy vpon the merits of others; for the prayers and ſupplications of Saints for vs, haue their force, and that ſurely very great; but then truly, when we our ſelues doe withall by our penitence request and ſue for the ſame.</hi> And making the like diſcourſe in another place, he concludeth thus:<note place="margin">Homil. <hi>1.</hi> in <hi>1.</hi> ad Theſſal.</note> 
                  <hi>Knowing theſe thinges, neither let vs despiſe the prayers of the Saints, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs caſt all vpon them.</hi>

               <p>Nowe to the arguments for the <hi>Catholike</hi> party: my firſt argument ſhal be to proue, that we may pray to the Angels in heauen to bleſſe vs, and to pray for vs; to whome after our bleſſed Lady, vve aſſigne the firſt place in our Lytanie. We haue for our vvarrant the authority and example of the holy Patriarke <hi>Iacob,</hi> expreſly ſet downe in holy Scripture for prayer to Angels,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 48.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.</note> in theſe wordes: <hi>God before whome my fathers</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iſaac <hi>haue walked, God who hath fedde me from my youth vnto this preſent day, and the Angell that hath deliuered me from all euill, bleſſe theſe children.</hi> What can be more playne, then that this bleſſed old Patriarke did pray vnto his good Angell Guardian? <hi>Nay</hi> (ſaith M. PER.) <hi>for by the Angell there you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſt vnderſtand Christ; for that in</hi> Malachie <hi>Chriſt is ſignified by the Angell of the couenant.</hi> A bonny reaſon; becauſe that an Angell is once in the old Teſtament vſed to ſignifie Chriſt, therefore it ſhall ſignifie him in vvhat place ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Neither doth an Angell in that one place ſingly put, ſignifie Chriſt; but with an addition, <hi>the Angell of the couenant,</hi> to diſtinguiſh that Angell from all others: ſo that there is no appearance or colour of likelyhood, out of that place ſo vnlike, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete this. It remayneth then, that the vvord Angell be taken properly (as it is moſt commonly in holy Scripture) for an heauenly ſpirit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to keepe <hi>Iacob:</hi> vvhich I confirme by the circumſtance of the place; becauſe <hi>Iacob</hi> prayeth vnto that Angell, as to one that vvas then extant and liuing, that had alſo before deliuered him from many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils: but Chriſt vvas not then borne, nor had any doings in the vvorld, therefore he did not pray to him. Againe, the wiſe Patriarke and Prophet muſt be made to ſpeake very fondly, if he ſhould pray him that was not <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> to bleſſe thoſe children; he might very well haue prayed God for Chriſtes ſake (that vvas to come) to bleſſe them: but to pray Chriſt himſelfe, whome he knewe then not to be any where liuing or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to blſſe them, hath no ſence in it; for bleſſing (as all other working)
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23774:66"/> ſuppoſeth a reall being and exiſtence of the ſame party.

But the other point of their knowledge of our affaires is of greater difficulty: the which vve proue firſt, by the perfect knowledge they haue of God, which is as great, and alſo greater then ſome Angels haue, and ſo in that cleare mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Gods ſubſtance they may moſt eaſily ſee all that hath beene, is, or ſhall be ſaid or done vpon earth.

                  </hi> the Saints in heauen doe preſent vnto God the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of holy men liuing vpon the earth, therefore they knowe the ſame

               <p>M. PERKINS for an vpſhot ſaith, that <hi>he finally diſſenteth from the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, <hi>becauſe they are not content to pray to Saints, but ſay further; that God through their merits in heauen, doth beſtowe many benefits vpon vs on earth.</hi>

               <p>I would he agreed with vs in the two former points, we ſhould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be at accord in this: for the good-man is fouly miſtaken if he thinke that vve affirme the Saints (after they be come to heauen) to merit a newe there; for we hold that none after their death can merit any more, but doe then receiue according vnto their former merits, either ſaluation or damnation: but we neuertheleſſe ſay, that God in reſpect of their former merits gotten in this life, doth for their ſakes beſtowe many benefits vpon vs, and this doth M.

            </p>
            <p>It was ſo (in deede) in Chriſtes time, becauſe he taught them not all a once; but ſince the eſtabliſhment of the Goſpell, it is neceſſary that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one beleeue all the articles of the Apoſtles Creede, the true doctrine of the Sacraments, and ſuch other neceſſary heades of the Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: other points of faith may be learned in time, according vnto the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond fold</hi> of his faith is: <hi>that many</hi> (of his deceiued diſciples) <hi>haue not at their conuerſion, and in time of temptation, a full aſſurance of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which notwithſtanding will ſerue the turne then, if they deſire to haue a full aſſurance, and labour afterward to attayne vnto it: which</hi> he ſpeaketh <hi>to the comfort of their conſciences, that cannot perſwade themſelues ſo aſſuredly, that their ſinnes are pardoned them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This preſumptious doctrine of full aſſurance of ſaluation, I haue in a ſeueral queſtion before confuted; therefore I ſay only here, that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is bound to haue any ſuch abſolute aſſurance of his owne ſaluation, but that he muſt (according to the Apoſtles rule) <hi>worke his ſaluation with trembling and feare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Philip. <hi>2.</hi> verſ. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> conſidering his owne frailty: Marry, very good hope and confidence ought we all to haue, in reſpect of Gods infinite mercy and goodneſſe, and in the ineſtimable merits of our Lord and Sauiour

            <p>In the matter of our difference, he ſaith firſt; <hi>That we teach not faith to be a knowledge of thinges beleeued; but a reuerent aſſent vnto them, whether they be knowne or vnknowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this he ſaith very vntruly: for we hold faith in his owne nature, to comprehend a certayne kinde of knowledge, though not ſo cleare and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident; yet of as great aſſurance, as is the knowledge of naturall thinges: but the man harpeth vpon ſomething elſe, if he could hitte on it. We ſay (indeede) that it is not of neceſſity, for the ſimpler ſort and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to reade the holy Scriptures, and to goe fiſh their faith out of that profound Ocean; but may content themſelues with their Paſtors inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and with their Catechiſmes and other bookes of piety and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: albeit, we wiſh them of better vnderſtanding (if they be not too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and wilfull) to reade the holy Scriptures vvith reuerence, ſeeking humbly to better their knowledge, and eſpecially to amend their liues; and in places of difficulty, not to truſt vnto their owne wits, but to referre themſelues to the expoſition of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, <hi>which is the pillar and fortreſſe of truth:</hi> and there vpon vvholy to rely.

Let thoſe our Authors which teach caſes of conſcience, be conſulted in thoſe points, and you ſhall finde them to charge euery man in conſcience, to knowe all theſe thinges, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſome men haue thought to the contrary; who be not in that allowed, but diſproued euen by the teſtimony of that Authour <hi>Banes</hi> vvhome M.

            <p>And touching praying in <hi>Latin,</hi> the lawes of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church doth not bind any man to pray in <hi>Latin,</hi> who is not firſt bound to learne the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> tongue, that is: men in holy orders are bound to their <hi>Latin</hi> Breuiary; but no man ignorant of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, muſt be admitted vnto holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: for them that are ignorant of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, vve haue diuers bookes of <hi>Engliſh</hi> prayers, vvherein they may exerciſe themſelues fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.

               <p>
                  <hi>WE differ in two thinges: firſt, concerning the place, the</hi> Catholikes <hi>hold it to be vnder the ground, into which mens ſoules after this life doe enter. This we deny as hauing no warrant in the word, which mentioneth only two places for men after this life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Here M. PER. beginneth the diſproofe of Purgatory with his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hackney, <hi>it is not mentioned in the Scriptures.</hi> To which I anſwere firſt, that it is, as ſhall be proued hereafter: but if it were not, yet were it to be beleeued, becauſe it vvas receiued by Tradition euen from the Apoſtles
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:23774:73"/> time. Beſides this fault in M. PER. argument, there is another more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, to wit: becauſe there is no mention made of Purgatory in three or foure places by him quoted, he concludeth that it hath no warrant at all, in any other place of Scriptures; as who ſhould ſay, there is no Doctor of Phiſicke in two or three Colledges of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> therefore there is not one in all the Vniuerſity beſides. Finally,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.</note> the very firſt place by him ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ouerthroweth flatly his owne poſition, it being truly vnderſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the generall expoſition of the moſt learned Doctors: for <hi>Abraham</hi> then was not in heauen, but in a third place called <hi>Lymbo Patrum;</hi> becauſe, before Chriſt had paid their ranſome by his death on the croſſe, the Fathers of the old Teſtament were holden captiue: and ſo of Chriſt it is ſaid, <hi>That aſcending on high, he ledde captiuity captiue.</hi>

               <p>But he goeth forward and ſaith ſtoutly, that there can be no place for Purgatory: for that it is ſaide, <hi>That they who dyed in the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>are bidden to reſt from their labours: which cannot be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if they goe into Purgatory. And to cut off all cauils, it is further ſaid, their workes (that is) the reward of their workes followe them,</hi> euen at the heeles.</p>
               <p>I anſwere firſt, that we haue here by the way, heauen to be the reward of workes by M. PER. confeſſion, which in the queſtion of merits he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied moſt abſolutely. Secondly, that albeit they who die in our Lord, doe not goe to Purgatory, yet many others may;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>20.</hi> de ciuit. c. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe according vnto <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> judgement, and the holy bretheren of <hi>Geneua,</hi> this place is to be vnderſtood of Martirs only, who die for our Lord. And we that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Purgatory, doe hold that no Martir doth goe thither; but being (as it were) a new baptized in their owne bloud, doe appeare before the face of God without any ſpotte: whereas other ordinary good Chriſtians be not free from all ſuch ſtaines, and may alſo haue much penance at their death not performed, which they muſt endure in Purgatory. I ſay third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if the vvordes ſhould be applyed to all Chriſtians that die in the grace of God; yet is there nothing in them againſt Purgatory. For the wordes following may well be ſpoken of them that goe thither; becauſe they both <hi>rest from their labours,</hi> which they had in their former life: and alſo enjoy an aſſurance of heauen, without any ſuch peril or hazard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as they liued in before: and <hi>their workes</hi> may very well be ſaid to <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe them;</hi> for that according vnto the rate of their workes, they muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:23774:74"/> the fire of purgatory, either more or leſſe. Fourthly, I may anſwere with <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> on that place; that they who die in our Lord, <hi>from that time</hi> there ſpoken off,<note place="margin">

But theſe thinges profit them, who when they liued, did deſerue that theſe thinges might profit them: for there is a certayne kinde of life neither ſo good, that it doth not neede theſe after their death, neither ſo euill, but that theſe thinges will profit him after his death. There is a life ſo good, that it needeth not theſe thinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and againe another ſo euill, that cannot be holpen with them,</hi> &amp;c.

Thus much (by the way) out of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> for a taſte of his opinion touching Purgatory. Nowe to the reſt of M. PERKINS teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Cyril <hi>ſaith: They which are once dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> in Eſaiam.</note> 
                  <hi>can adde nothing to the thinges that they haue done, but ſhall remayne as they were left, and wayte for the time of the last judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is ſuch a citation as ſendeth to no peece of his vvorkes; yet, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing difficult to be anſwered if any ſuch be: for the very next ſentence that he alleadgeth will ſerue to ſolue it, which is out of <hi>S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> who ſaith: <hi>That after the end of this life there be no occaſions of merit.</hi> To both vvhich the anſwere is, that a man after his death cannot merit any more, becauſe merit only belongeth vnto men while they liue: after death they may well reape the due reward of their merits, or elſe ſuffer juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their former offences. Neyther can a man that is dead alter his eſtate, but muſt expect judgement according to his former deſerts. Now, if he haue vpon the true foundation builded wood, hay, and ſtubble, then he muſt paſſe through the fire: marry, by the helpe of good prayers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and principally by the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> he may haue his paines
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:23774:75"/> in that purging fire, remitted or much eaſed; as you haue heard before out of <hi>S. Auguſtine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hom. <hi>41.</hi> in <hi>1.</hi> ad Corinth.</note> And the ſame teacheth <hi>S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> ſaying: <hi>The dead are holpen not by their friendes weeping; but by their prayers, ſupplications, and almes.</hi> And this is all in effect which M. PERKINS diſputeth againſt Purgatory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we differ from them touching the meanes of Purgatory. They ſay that men are purged by ſuffering of paines in Purgatory, whereby they ſatisfie for their veniall ſinnes, and for the temporall puniſhment of their mortall ſinnes: We teach the contrary, holding that nothing can free vs, from the leaſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the ſmalleſt ſinne, but the ſufferinges of Chriſt. Indeede they ſay, that our ſufferinges in themſelues conſidered, doe not purge and ſatisfie; but as they are made meritorious by the ſufferings of Chriſt. But to this I oppoſe one text of Scripture:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</note> Chriſt hath purged our ſinnes by himſelfe; <hi>where the last clauſe cuts the throate of all humane ſatisfactions and merits: and it giueth vs to vnderſtand, that whatſoeuer purgeth vs from our ſinnes, is not to be found in vs, but in Christ alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To batter this his only fortreſſe, his owne wordes in the beginning of the ſame Chapter, are very ſufficient: for there he plainely teacheth, <hi>That by afflictions which men ſuffer in this world, they are clenſed from their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as gold is from the droſſe by fire.</hi> If our owne ſuffering purge vs from ſinne (as he confeſſeth before) howe then can it be true, that that vvhich purgeth vs from our ſinnes, is not in vs, but in Chriſt alone? Againe, it is but a diuers reading in the <hi>Greeke</hi> text, that hath thoſe wordes, <hi>by himſelfe;</hi> for they are not in the <hi>Latin</hi> tranſlation. But admitting them for currant, the ſence is moſt eaſie, and nothing againſt eyther Purgatory or humane ſatisfactions: for the Apoſtle meaneth no other thing thereby, then that he expreſſeth in the 9. Chapter following, to wit: <hi>That Christ not by the bloud of Calues or Goates, but by his owne bloud, purged vs from our ſinnes, and wrought our redemption;</hi> in ſuch ſort as in the queſtion of ſatisfaction hath beene declared at large. Here I ſay briefly, that Chriſt appeaſed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath, towardes all ſuch as ſhal be made pertakers of his merits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the ſinne it ſelfe, and paide the eternall puniſhment due vnto their ſinnes; but left a temporall paine to be endured of the offendour (for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſuch ſinne pardoned) eyther in this world, or in the next: both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe reaſon requireth, that he vvho falleth after that he was once freely pardoned (as vve were all in baptiſme) ſhould not the ſecond time be ſo eaſilie admitted into Gods grace, as that he ſhould not himſelfe feele ſome ſmart for his offence. Againe, we being members of Chriſts body, meete it is that <hi>we ſuffer with him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>if we will raigne with him,</hi> as the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: vvho alſo was ſo bold as to ſay, <hi>that he in his body accompliſhed thoſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:23774:75"/> thinges, that wanted to the paſſions of Christ.</hi> To this place M. PER. referreth prayer for the dead, of which he propoundeth three concluſions: two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue, and one negatiue, but proueth nothing.</p>
               <p>The firſt concluſion: <hi>We hold that Chriſtian charity muſt extend it ſelfe to them that be dead, to wit: in honeſt buriall of them, in preſeruing their good names, and in reliefe of their poſterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond concluſion: <hi>Further we pray in generall for the faithfull depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that God would haſten their joyfull reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third concluſion: <hi>To pray for particular men departed, and to pray for their deliuerance out of Purgatory, we thinke it vnlawfull; becauſe we haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſe, nor commandement ſo to doe:</hi> and ſo endeth he the queſtion of Purgatory, not propounding one argument in fauour of our party.</p>
               <p>His reaſon of the neceſſity of a promiſe and commandement to pray for any thing, before we pray for it, I haue in the queſtion of praying to Saints confuted at large, and therefore omit it here: and will furniſh this place vvith ſome arguments for the proofe of Purgatory. And though M. PER. bluſhed not to ſay, that it hath no warrant in the word of God; yet he hath, or might haue ſeene in <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi>

And (gentle Reader) remember here that which hath beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearſed out of <hi>S. Auguſtine:</hi> that <hi>there be ſome</hi> who die in ſo perfect an eſtate, that they are carryed preſently to heauen; as all Innocents, and Martirs, and ſuch other holy perſonages who commit fewe offences, and yet doe leade a very auſtere life. <hi>Others there be</hi> too too many, vvho both liue and die wickedly; ſuch are alſo ſtraight after their death, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the flames of hell fire. Nowe, <hi>There is a third ſort of men,</hi> who liue reaſonable honeſtly, at leaſt doe die very penitently; theſe only goe to Purgatory, there to doe ſatisfaction for their former offences, before they can be admitted into the joyes of heauen: nowe to our proofes.</p>

But one of milder temper may (perhaps) demand, howe thoſe bookes that were at the firſt doubted off by many, and not generally receiued for Canonicall, could afterward be made Canonicall? to this I anſwere, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (as vvell as we) doe take nowe for Canonicall, ſome ſuch bookes as were 300. yeares after Chriſt doubted off, to wit: the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes, S. Iames</hi> Epiſtle, the ſecond of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> the ſecond and third of <hi>S. Iohn, S. Iudes</hi> Epiſtle, and the Apocalipſe, or Reuelation of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> Nowe, they themſelues ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing admitted all theſe of the newe Teſtament for Canonicall, vpon the judgement and declaration of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church: vvhy doe they not as vvell take thoſe of the old Teſtament for Canonicall alſo, the ſame Church hauing aboue a thouſand yeares paſt, approued them for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, as well as the other? At the firſt, becauſe of the great perſecutions, the learned could not ſo generally meete together, to examine &amp; diſcuſſe ſuch matters, as afterward in the peace of the Church; and therefore in that time diuers men vvere of diuers opinions, concerning the authority of ſuch bookes: but vvhen the learned in the Church, aſſembling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the name of God, and hauing the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt to direct them, had once declared which were Canonicall, which not; there was no further queſtion among the obedient children of the Church: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnskilfull men, or <hi>Heretikes</hi> (becauſe they will be chooſers) will admit of vvhich it pleaſeth them, and reject alſo thoſe vvhich diſpleaſe them. But to leaue this digreſſion; the bookes of the <hi>Machabees</hi> cannot but haue euen with <hi>Heretikes,</hi> farre greater credit, then <hi>Liuie, Plutarke,</hi> and ſuch like prophane hyſtories,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Our Sauiour Chriſt willeth vs to agree with our aduerſary, whiles we are in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23774:76"/> the way with him, leaſt perhaps he deliuer vs to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and ſo we be caſt into priſon: for verily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt not goe out from thence, till thou repay the laſt farthing.</hi> By this parable or example, our Sauiour teacheth vs vvhiles we liue in this vvorld, to agree vvith the lawe of God, vvhich is our aduerſary when we tranſgreſſe and offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; otherwiſe at our death we ſhall juſtly be caſt into priſon, and lye there till we haue fully ſatisfied and paid the laſt farthing of our debt. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, that he who is ſo caſt into priſon ſhal neuer come out: We ſay the contrary, that this parable concerneth them eſpecially that ſhall be deliuered at the length, and proue it; firſt becauſe the parable is not taken from a <hi>murtherer</hi> or <hi>theefe,</hi> vvho may be juſtly condemned to death, or to perpetuall priſon; but of a <hi>debter,</hi> who ordinarily doth gette out in time: and therefore it agreeth better vnto men caſt in Purgatory, to pay the debt of the former treſpaſſes, then to them that are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hell.

               <p>Moreouer, that there is ſuch pardon graunted after this life to ſome, is confirmed by that vvhich our Sauiour ſaith in another place:<note place="margin">

And the learned knowe, that in enumeration of partes, it is as foule a fault to reckon ſomething for a part which is none, as to omit ſome true part
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23774:77"/> indeede: ſo that then our Lord parting the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes into this world, and the world to come, in all congruity of ſpeech we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that ſome ſinnes are forgiuen in the world to come; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in heauen, where none are; nor in hell where there is no remiſſion of ſinne: therefore it muſt be in a third place, which we call Purgatory.</p>

               <p>The third text of the newe Teſtament, ſhall be taken out of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> vvhere he (by a ſimilitude of building) declareth; that <hi>ſome men vpon the only ſound foundation</hi> IESVS <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>doe build gold, ſiluer, and pretious ſtones,</hi> that is, very excellent and perfect workes: <hi>others doe build vpon the ſame foundation, wood, hay, and ſtubble,</hi> that is, imperfect and many vaine trifling workes. He addeth: that <hi>the day of our Lord, which ſhall be reuealed in fire, ſhal proue the workes of the afore-ſaid builders:</hi> and <hi>they who haue built gold, ſiluer, and pretious ſtones,</hi> becauſe their workes will abide the proofe of fire, <hi>ſhall receiue their reward;</hi> but becauſe the other ſort of builders workes <hi>cannot reſist the fire,</hi> but will burne, <hi>they ſhall ſuffer detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſhall be ſaued, yet ſo as by fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we gather, that after the triall of Gods judgement, ſome men who are found guilty of lighter faults, ſhall be ſaued, becauſe they keept the foundation; notwithſtanding they ſhall ſuffer detriment, and paſſe through the fire of Purgatory: as a man that hath an halfe-timber houſe couered with thetch, ſet on fire; he being in the middeſt of it, muſt paſſe through the flames of fire, to eſcape and ſaue his life. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, that <hi>it is the fire of tribulation in this life that doth try our workes, and that through it only lighter faults are purged.</hi> We reply firſt, that tribulation of this life, doth not commonly diſcerne and try good mens workes from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23774:77"/> the badde; becauſe very often good men are more afflicted in this world then the badde. Againe, it is ſaid in the text, that <hi>at the day of our Lord</hi> this tryall ſhall be made; vvhich <hi>day of our Lord</hi> being expreſſed vvith the <hi>Greeke</hi> article (as here it is) ordinarily in Scripture ſignifieth the day of his judgement; ſo that by the very circumſtances of the text it is very plaine, that the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul</hi> deliuered the doctrine of Purgatory: which yet is made more aſſured by the vniuerſall conſent of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who take this place to proue Purgatory. See <hi>Origen, homil.</hi> 6. <hi>in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odum. S. Baſil</hi> ſaith: <hi>He threatneth not vtter ruine and deſtruction,</hi>

                  <hi>S.

Hierome <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> Amos. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in almoſt twenty places, expoundeth this text after the ſame manner. Heare this one taken out of his Commentary vpon the 37. Pſalme: <hi>O Lord reproue me not in thy indignation, that I goe not to hell; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther correct me in thy wrath, but purge me in this life, and make me ſuch a one, that ſhall haue no neede of that purging fire, prepared for them who ſhall be ſaued; yet ſo, as by fire. And why ſo? but becauſe here they doe build vpon the foundation, wood, hay, and ſtubble: if they did build gold, ſiluer, and pretious ſtones, they ſhould be ſafe from both fires; not only from that euerlaſting, which is to puniſh the wicked euerlaſtingly, but from that alſo, which ſhall correct them who ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by fire: for it is ſaid, he ſhall be ſaued, yet ſo as by fire. And becauſe he ſhall be ſaued, that fire is contemned: yea truly, though they ſhall be ſaued, yet that fire is more grieuous, then whatſoeuer a man can ſuffer in this life.</hi> Theſe fewe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the moſt approued Doctors, may ſuffice to aſſure vs, that the Apoſtles ſpeeches are to be taken of a purging fire, prepared after this life for them, that vpon their true faith in Chriſt doe build (through the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our nature) many idle, odde, and vaine workes.</p>
               <p>The laſt text of holy Scripture ſhall be this, taken out of <hi>S. Iohn:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>He that knoweth his brother to ſinne a ſinne not vnto death; let him aske, and life ſhall be giuen him: there is a ſinne to death, for that I ſay not that any man aske.</hi> Hence I reaſon thus: a ſinne to death, muſt in this place needs be taken for ſinne, wherein a man dyeth; for which no man can pray, becauſe that he vvho dyeth in deadly ſinne, ſhall neuer afterward be pardoned: wherefore, a ſinne not vnto death, is a ſinne of vvhich a man repenteth him before his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:23774:78"/> death; and for ſuch a one doth <hi>S. Iohn</hi> exhort vs to pray: therefore, the prayer which he ſpeaketh of when he biddeth vs not pray, being prayer for the dead; the other prayer alſo, muſt be prayer for the departed: and ſo doth he will vs to pray for ſuch men departed, that dyed not in deadly ſinne, but with repentance. The <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> ſay, <hi>That</hi> S. Iohn <hi>ſpeaketh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Apoſtataes, and ſome ſuch like haynous offendors, for whome yet aliue he would not haue vs to pray.</hi> But this is very vvicked doctrine; for vve may pray euen for <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the moſt ſinnefull perſons that liue, whiles they liue and haue time to repent: for vvhat knowe vve, whether God vvill take them to mercy or no? and <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>To theſe arguments ſelected out of holy Scripture, I will joyne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of no ſmaller moment with vs <hi>Catholikes,</hi> which is drawne from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall tradition, and the practiſe of the vniuerſall Church in her primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue purity; which hath vſed alwayes to pray for the dead. Let vs heare two or three ſubſtantiall vvitneſſes ſpeake in this matter. <hi>S. Chryſostome</hi> that moſt renowmed Patriarke of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhall be the firſt, vvho ſaith:<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>69.</hi> ad populu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>That it was not without good cauſe ordayned and decreed by the Apoſtles, that in the dreadfull myſteries there be made a commemoration of the dead. For they did knowe, that they ſhould receiue thereby great profit and much commodity. S. Auguſtine</hi> as famous for his learning and ſincerity in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, as the other was in the <hi>Greeke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De verbis Apoſtoli ſerm. <hi>34.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith to this point thus: <hi>It is not to be doubted, but that the dead are holpen by the prayers of holy Church, and by the comfortable ſacrifice, and by the almes that are giuen for their ſoules, that God may deale more mercifully with them, then their ſinnes deſerued. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the vniuerſall Church obſerueth and keepeth this, as by tradition receiued from the Fathers, that for them who are departed in the communion of the body and bloud of Christ, when at the ſacrifice there is made a commemoration or mention of them, they are prayed for; and the ſacrifice is remembred to be offered for them.</hi> The third witneſſe is <hi>Tertullian</hi> a moſt auncient and learned authour:<note place="margin">De corona militis.</note> who <hi>reckoneth it among the traditions of the Apoſtles, to pray for the ſoules of the faithfull departed.</hi> It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring then ſo manifeſt, by the teſtimony of ſuch approued witneſſes, that to pray for the dead is an Apoſtolicall tradition, generally receiued and practiſed in the moſt flouriſhing ſtate of the Church; <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict muſt needes proue true, who ſaith: that <hi>it is a point of most inſolent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to dispute againſt that, which the whole Church doth practiſe.</hi> Wherefore, our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> vvere 1300. yeares agoe, condemned for <hi>Heretikes</hi> in this
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:23774:78"/> point in one <hi>Aerius,</hi> vvho vvas cenſured by that holy and learned Biſhop Epiphanius, <hi>haereſ.</hi> 75. and by <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ad <hi>Quodvult deum,</hi> haereſ. 53. an <hi>Heretike;</hi> becauſe <hi>that to the</hi> Arrian <hi>hereſie he added this of his owne, that we muſt not offer ſacrifice nor pray for the ſoules of the departed:</hi> ſo that to denie prayer for the dead, is by the judgement of the auncient Church, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med flat hereſie.</p>
               <p>To theſe former authorities, let vs adde one reaſon deducted alſo out of the vvord of God. <hi>When a ſinner is truly conuerted, though the fault and eternall paine due to it, be through Chriſtes merits freely pardoned him; yet, there remayneth ſome temporall puniſhment to be ſuffered by the party himſelfe, for the ſame offence before remitted.</hi> This propoſition is denyed by the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but it is ſo manifeſtly ſet downe in Gods vvord, that they cannot but be put to great ſhame for it, if they be vrged with the examples of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and <hi>Dauid;</hi>

                  </note> who were all firſt pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of their ſinnes, and afterward put to penance for the very ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as I haue in the matter of ſatisfaction more amply proued. Nowe to the preſent purpoſe: <hi>But many who haue beene great offendors, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted till towardes their death; or elſe being conuerted long before, doe not fulfill ſuch penance, as in justice is due vnto their grieuous and manifold former of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences:</hi> therefore, the due order of Gods juſtice requireth, that after their death they accompliſh that which was wanting in their life time. To this nothing elſe can be anſwered, but that which ſome of them doe anſwere: that the very death vvhich euery one endureth, doth ſerue to ſupply all former defectes of his life, and purgeth him cleane from all payne due to his former ſinnes: but this is ſaid both without authority, or any reaſon. For a naturall death is due vnto all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> for original ſinne; in ſo much as the very innocents baptiſed are not freed from it: and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, that cannot be alſo a ſatisfaction for all other actuall ſinnes. Againe, ſome vvho haue deſerued great puniſhment, die ſuddainely, and vvith ſmall payne: ſo that there is no proportin betweene the payne of their death, and their former treſpaſſes. We denie not, but that ſuch may be both the length and ſharpeneſſe of the ſickeneſſe whereof ſome die; that it being patiently taken may either greatly diminiſh, or (perhaps) wholy extinguiſh al former offences: but to ſay that euery ones ordinary death, doth cancell all former obligation of ſinnes, howe many or howe great ſoeuer they were, hath neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>THe Church of</hi> Rome <hi>giueth to</hi> Peter <hi>a ſupremacy vnder Chriſt aboue all perſons and cauſes: this ſtandeth in a power to determine which bookes of Scripture be Canonicall, and what is the true ſence of any doubtfull place of them; and for this purpoſe to call and aſſemble generall Councels, and to confirme the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of them, and by theſe meanes to decide all controuerſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> about matter of faith. Beſides, he can excommunicate any Christian be he King or Kaeſar, if they by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate withſtanding Gods lawes or the decrees of holy Church, ſhal juſtly deſerue it. Moreouer, to him it doth belong to make Eccleſiaſticall Canons and lawes, for the due diſcipline and ordering of matters of the Church, which doe binde in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Finally, to confirme the election of Biſhops, and to decide all ſuch greater controuerſies, as by appeale are brought vnto him from any part of Chriſtendome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe indeede be the chiefeſt points of the <hi>Popes</hi> ſupremacy: as for that <hi>of pardoning of ſinnes,</hi> it is no proper part of his primacy, but common vnto all; not only to Biſhops, but alſo to Prieſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We</hi> (ſaith M. PERKINS) <hi>hold, that neyther</hi> Peter <hi>nor any Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>had or hath any ſuch ſupremacy ouer the</hi> Catholike <hi>Church: but that all ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy vnder Chriſt is appertaining to Kinges and Princes with him in their Dominions. And that our doctrine is good and theirs falſe, I will make manifeſt by ſundry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. First, Chriſt muſt be conſidered as he was a King, two wayes: firſt, as he is God, ſo is he King ouer al by right of creation; and ſo as God hath deputies on earth to gouerne the world, namely Kings and Princes. Secondly, he is King by right of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23774:80"/> redemption ouer the whole Church, which he hath redeemed with his pretious bloud; and ſo as mediatour and redeemer, he hath no fellowe nor deputy: for no creature is capable of this office, to doe in the roome and ſtead of Chriſt that which himſelfe doth; becauſe euery worke of the mediatour muſt ariſe from the effectes of two natures concurring in one action, namely the God-head and Man-hood. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, Chriſtes Prieſt-hood cannot paſſe from his perſon to any other; whence it followeth, that neyther his Kingly, nor his Propheticall</hi> (he vvould haue ſaid Prieſtly) <hi>office, can paſſe from him to any creature. Nay, it is needleſſe for Chriſt to haue a deputy, conſidering that a deputy only ſerueth to ſupply the abſence of the principall: whereas Christ is alwayes preſent by his word and ſpirit, it may be ſaid that the Miniſters in the worke of the miniſtery are Chriſtes deputies. I anſwere, that they are no deputies, but only actiue inſtruments; becauſe they doe only vtter the word, but it is Chriſt that worketh in the hart. In like manner in excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is Chriſt that cutteth that excommunicate perſon from the Kingdome of heauen; and the Church doth only declare this, by cutting him off from the reſt of Chriſtes people, vntill he repent: ſo that in all Eccleſiaſticall actions, Chriſt hath no deputies but only inſtruments, the whole action being perſonall in respect of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this trowe you a prety peece of an argument? but we muſt beare with the length of it, becauſe it alone will ſerue (as M. PER. opineth) to ouerthrowe many points of Popery: let it be therefore wel conſidered of. To it then I say firſt, that if it be ought worth, it as well ouerthroweth the <hi>Kinges,</hi> as the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy. For if the <hi>Pope</hi> may not be Chriſtes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, as he is mediatour and gouernour of his Church, becauſe that no creature can be his deputy in any point of Eccleſiaſticall gouernement as M. PER. defineth; then ſurely no King nor Prince, who are meere crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (and not one of them I trowe, both God and Man) can be Chriſtes deputy in the gouernement of his Church. I ſay ſecondly, that a meere creature may be Chriſt our mediatours deputy and Vicar in the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall gouernement of his Church: neyther is there therein any one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that neceſſarily proceedeth from the two natures of God and Man, as M. PER. dreameth. Examine all the points of Supremacy propoſed in the difference by himſelfe, and ſee vvhether there be any one that muſt needes be the action of both God and Man: to call a generall Councell is none ſuch, nor to ratifie the decrees thereof; to diſcuſſe and declare which bookes be Canonicall Scripture, and vvhat is the true meaning of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure places therein contayned, may be done by men aſſiſted by the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the holy Ghoſt: and ſo among all the reſt, there is not one point of the Supremacy, but may be vvell executed by a mortall man aſſiſted with Gods ſpirit. The points of Chriſtes mediation, namely to ſatisfie
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:23774:81"/> his Fathers vvrath by paying him the full ranſome of all mankinde; the eſtabliſhing of a newe Teſtament or lawe; the creation of ſpirituall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; the furniſhing of it with Sacraments, and ſuch like are indeede ſo proper to Chriſt, that they cannot be communicated vnto others: Marry, to ſee that his lawes be vvell obſerued, lawfull Gouernours and Miniſters elected, and his Sacraments rightly adminiſtred; the chardge (I ſay) of theſe thinges may be very vvell committed vnto his deputies, and the principall ouer-ſight of all vnto one ſupreme gouernour vnder himſelfe, that all the inferiour Prelates may be holden in peace and vnity. And to ſay that Chriſtes preſence, by his vvord and ſpirit is ſufficient to diſſolue all doubtes that ariſe about matter of faith, and to reforme all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour that is among Chriſtians, without the authority of ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to ſee the ſame vvell declared, and applyed vnto particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; is to ſpeake againſt all reaſon and experience. For vvho ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme obſtinate <hi>Heretikes?</hi> Chriſtes vvord? but <hi>Heretikes</hi> haue alwayes ſaid, and will euer ſay that it maketh for them. Shall Chriſtes ſpirit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them? they hold that they haue that ſpirit in ſuch aboundance, that it cryeth in them, <hi>Abba, Father:</hi> ſo that M. PER. argument driueth to this, that there muſt be no gouernour at all; but that euery wrangling fellowe, is to be left vnto the vvord and ſpirit of Chriſt: vvhich is moſt abſurd in matter of gouernement. And albeit that in producing of ſupernaturall effectes, men be but Gods inſtruments: yet becauſe they be inſtruments indued with reaſon, choſen by God, and enabled to doe that whereunto they are by Chriſt appointed; I ſee no reaſon why they may not be well called Chriſtes <hi>deputies.</hi> Sure I am, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> feareth not to ſtile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the other Apoſtles,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9,</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſtes Legates or Ambaſſadours:</hi> which is as much, if not more then his deputies. And in an other place, he goeth yet further, and ſaith; that <hi>they are coadjutors,</hi> or <hi>fellowe worke-men with God:</hi> for though it be Gods worke, as the only <hi>efficient cauſe;</hi> yet men doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre thereunto as his <hi>inſtruments,</hi> and doe in their kinde worke properly towards the producing of the effect: as the Preacher by his perſwaſions, zeale, and piety, doth very much moue his Auditors to embrace Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, although he ſhould labour in vaine if God d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Touching the matter of gouernement, I cannot vnderſtand what M. PER. meaneth when he ſaith, that euery action thereof proceedeth from the very perſon of Chriſt: for vvhen the Biſhops or congregation doth excommunicate an offendour, howe can that act of theirs be perſonal in

               <p>Nowe <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſecond kinde of thinges: but againſt this M.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> What meaneth this man by Paſtors? doth he comprehend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops vvithin that word? then he ouerthroweth himſelfe: for if ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors be yet neceſſary, then is it needfull that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> doe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede <hi>S.

If by <hi>Paſtors</hi> he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Pariſh Prieſtes or Miniſters that haue charge of flockes, and by Teachers other Preachers; then doth he here as much for the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as in his laſt diſcourſe he did for <hi>temporall Princes,</hi> that is: as he vvent about there to proue, that Chriſt as our redeemer, could haue no creature for his deputy in gouernement; and conſequently that Kings cannot be Chriſts Lieutenants in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes: ſo here he doth inſinuate, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops be not neceſſary to the building vp of Chriſtes Church, but the Miniſter of euery Pariſh with the Elders thereof, will ſuffice for ordinary
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:23774:82"/> matters; and that affaires of greater moment muſt be referred (belike) to the Conſiſtoriall aſſembly of many Miniſters and Elders togither. Doth not this ſauour rankely of Puritaniſme? but becauſe he only ſaith this without any proofe, let it ſuffice for anſwere to ſay; that as Miniſters are neceſſary to teach the word of God, and to adminiſter the Sacraments: ſo are Biſhops both to inſtitute and ordayne the Miniſters, and to ſee, that they doe diligently diſcharge their duty. And as Biſhops are neceſſary to ouer-ſee Prieſts and Miniſters: ſo are Archbiſhops and Metropolitanes to looke vnto Biſhops, and to prouide that there be no ſchiſmes or diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among them, and to determine their controuerſies, if any ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them.

               <p>M.

                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> do conſid.</note> 
                  <hi>it is playne that here dominion is forbidden the Apoſtles: goe to then, dare you (if you will) to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you ruling an Apoſtleſhip; or in your Apoſtleſhip, rule and dominion? if you will haue both alike, you ſhall leefe both: otherwiſe you must not thinke your ſelfe excempted from the number of them, of whome the Lord complayned; ye haue ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned, but not of me.</hi>

                  <hi>That he who is greater among you, let him become as the leſſer, and he that is your leader</hi> (or as it is in the <hi>Greeke égouménos</hi> your Captaine or Prince) <hi>let him be your wayter.</hi> See, he vvill haue among them one greater then the reſt, to be their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptayne and leader; which he confirmeth with his owne example, ſaying: <hi>As I my ſelfe came not to be wayted on, or miniſtred vnto, but came to minister or to wayte vpon others:</hi> ſo that this diſcourſe of our Sauiours, only diſproueth in Chriſtians ſuch Lord-like domination as vvas then in vſe among the <hi>Gentils,</hi> who were giuen for the moſt part, to take their owne pleaſures to ouer-rule lawes as they liſted, to oppreſſe their ſubjects with taxes, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:23774:83"/> to vſe them like ſlaues. Nowe in Eccleſiaſticall gouernementall muſt be otherwiſe: the Prelate muſt not ſeeke his owne eaſe, wealth, or pleaſure, but moſt vigilantly ſtudy day and night to feede and profit his flocke, vvith whome he muſt conuerſe moſt modeſtly, not ſcorning or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſpeake familiarly vvith the meaneſt amongſt them. And this is that vvhich <hi>S. Bernard</hi> counſaileth <hi>Eugenius</hi> to doe; <hi>To rule as an Apoſtle, and not to ouer-rule</hi> or to dominier like vnto ſome temporal Princes: which in the ſame booke he doth plainely teach, ſaying: <hi>That when</hi> Eugenius <hi>was created</hi> Pope, <hi>he then was exalted ouer Nations and Kingdomes, yet not to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer ouer them, but to ſerue them.</hi> And further, he doth in the ſame booke deliuer the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy in theſe moſt euident wordes, ſpeaking thus to the ſame <hi>Pope</hi> Eugenius: <hi>Who art thou? a great Priest, the higheſt Biſhop; thou art the Prince of the Biſhops, the heyre of the Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou art he to whome the keyes of heauen were deliuered, to whome the ſheepe were committed. There are alſo indeede other Porters of heauen, and Paſtors of ſheepe; but thou art ſo much the more glorious, as thou haſt inherited a more excellent name aboue them. They haue their flockes to each man me; but to thee all were committed, as one flocke to one Paſtor. Thou art not only Paſtor of the ſheepe, but of all other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, thou alone art the Pastor.</hi> Thus farre <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> This man will neuer leaue playing the Sophiſter, and vſing of fallacies inſteade of ſound arguments: vvhat a reaſon is this? there is no mention made of the ſupreme Paſtors calling in one place of <hi>S.

Let vs returne this his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vpon his owne pate: In that place of the Apoſtle, there is no mention made of the Kinges ſupreme authority in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, but rather a playne declaration that the Church of God needeth no ſuch officer for her Eccleſiaſticall gouernement: <hi>ergo,</hi> Kinges haue no ſuch authority. And becauſe M. PER. ſeemeth not greatly to care for the Princes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, let this argument be vrged againſt the admirable Elders of their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:23774:83"/> conſiſtoriall diſcipline; who notwithſtanding they be ſuch peereleſſe peeres of the reformed Churches, yet were vtterly concealed, or rather neuer thought vpon by the Apoſtle, when and where he mentioneth cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of leſſer moment. Nowe the direct anſwere to that place may be twofold: eyther that there is not mention made of all Church officers, as it is euident and muſt be confeſſed on all parts; or elſe that by conuenient interpretation, they may be reduced vnto ſome of them there named, and ſo may the ſupreme Paſtor of Chriſtes Church be contayned well in that name of Paſtors; or becauſe it belongeth vnto the ſupreme Paſtor to haue a generall care of all Chriſtendome, and to ſend alwayes ſome to conuert Infidels, his chardge and calling may be well <hi>an Apoſtleſhip:</hi> as it is in the very wordes cited by M.

               <p>M.

                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>most fitly agreeth to the ſea of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the head thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> This is a capitall accuſation, and therefore ſhould haue bin throughly well proued, and yet you vvould meruaile to ſee how ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he goeth about it: I can ſcarſe bring his proofe into any forme of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is ſo ſubſtantiall. But thus he ſeemeth to argue: <hi>At the decay of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire the man of ſinne ſhal be reuealed: but the Sea of</hi> Rome <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſlouriſhed till the Empire decayed;</hi> ergo, <hi>that Sea is the man of ſinne.</hi> Here is a newe found manner of arguing: Let vs admit the firſt propoſition, becauſe it may hap to be true, though it be very vncertaine what is meant by <hi>that defection</hi> mentioned by <hi>S. Paul.</hi> But let vs graunt it: ſhall euery thing that beginneth then to flouriſh, be the man of ſinne? and if euery flouriſhing ſtate ſhall not then be that man of ſinne, vvhy ſhall the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> be rather that man of ſinne, then any other flouriſhing eſtate? ſure it is, that it hath no conſequence out of that argument. Secondly, it is moſt falſe alſo, that the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> neuer flouriſhed till the Empire decayed: for when did it euer flouriſh more, then in that good Emperors daies <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the great, and in many other excellent Chriſtian Emperors that liued an hundred yeares after him? Thirdly <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not of <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, or vvhatſoeuer elſe he meaneth; but rather of a <hi>generall reuolt, or vtter ruyne</hi> and decay of it, vvhich is not as yet happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for the Empire to this day yet continueth in ſome part of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Beameland;</hi> ſo that <hi>man of ſinne</hi> cannot be the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> vvhich ſo
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:23774:84"/> many yeares hath flouriſhed together with that <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Finally, <hi>S. Peter</hi> and three and thirty other <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> after him, enjoyed the ſupreme gouernement of the Church, more then foure hundred yeares before that declination &amp; decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which they ſpeake off: ſo that nothing can be more fond and abſurd, then to draw thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny argument againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> ſupremacy. And whereas he ſaith that all that chapter agreeth fitly to the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> I ſay &amp; wil briefly proue, that nothing in that Chapter agreeth vnto it any thing aptly. Firſt, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh of one particular man, as his vvordes doe manifeſtly ſhewe: for he calleth him <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſonne of perdition,</hi> and that with the <hi>Greeke</hi> article which doth more formally particularize; howe can this be applyed vnto more then two hundred <hi>Popes?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. <hi>4.</hi> In illum locum.</note> Secondly it is ſaid, that <hi>that man of ſinne ſhall be extolled aboue all that is called God:</hi> and as <hi>S.

                  <hi>Becauſe they receiued not the charity of truth, that they might be ſaued; therefore God will ſend them the operation of errour to beleeue lying:</hi> now al the <hi>Greeke</hi> interpreters doe vnderſtand this of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as the very text lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them.

                  <hi>Antichriſt ſhall doe all theſe ſignes not by the power, but by the permiſsion of God for the</hi> Iewes: <hi>that becauſe they would not receiue the charity of truth, that is, the ſpirit of God by Chriſt, and ſo receiuing the Sauiour, they might haue beene ſaued: God will ſend them, &amp;c.</hi> With theſe accord both <hi>S.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:23774:84"/> ſtand with the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> computation of Antichriſts raigne, which they drawe nine hundreth yeares in length already, and yet are vncertayne howe much remayneth behind. By this (I hope) you ſee, howe well you may truſt M. PER. on his word another time, who bluſhed not to affirme all the circumſtances of the man of ſinne related in that Chapter, to agree moſt fitly vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> when as not one ſentence there penned by the Apoſtle, doth touch him any whit at all, but are only by the wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of his enemies, violently torne and caſt vpon him.</p>
               <p>Nowe to M. PERKINS laſt reaſon, which is taken from the teſtimony of the auncient Church. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">De ſimpl. Praelator.</note> 
                  <hi>Doubtleſſe the ſame were the rest of the Apoſtles that</hi> Peter <hi>was, indued with equall fellowſhip both of honour and power, but a beginning is made of vnity that the Church may appeare to be one.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Doubtleſſe here is a prety peece of coſinage; for the words are ſtrooken out, vvhich vvould haue made all playne againſt the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants:</hi> for <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> there ſaith, that <hi>the beginning proceedeth from one, and the primacy is giuen to</hi> Peter, <hi>that the Church may appeare to be one:</hi> So that he allowing all the Apoſtles to be equall in honour, being all of the ſame cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and power to preach the Goſpell to all nations, yet affirmeth the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to haue beene giuen vnto <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith: <hi>If one be called vniuerſall Biſhop,</hi>

                  <hi>the vniuerſall Church goeth to decay.</hi> And cap. 144. <hi>I ſay boldly; that whoſoeuer calleth, or deſireth to call himſelfe vniuerſall Priest, in his pride he is a fore-runner of Antichrist.</hi> And lib. 7. cap. 30. <hi>Behold in the preface of your Epiſtle a proude title, calling me vniuerſall</hi> Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> I could vviſh that the cauſe might be determined by that bleſſed Biſhop <hi>S. Gregories</hi> ſentence, it were then already gayned on our ſide: for in thoſe bookes of his Epiſtles, he doth almoſt nothing elſe but declare the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy, in ordering of all Eccleſiaſticall matters, and that ouer all Countries; but whence the Bee ſucketh hony, thence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Spider draweth ſome poyſon. They regard not what or how much he vvriteth there in fauour of the Supremacy; but they thinke to haue ſome aduantage for their cauſe, out of that vvhich he writeth againſt the name of <hi>vniuerſall Biſhop</hi> or Prieſt, but they are miſerably deceiued: for one may very well be ſupreme head of the Church, and yet not vniuerſall Biſhop, as <hi>S.

Gregory,</hi> who is Biſhop in euery Dioceſſe of the vniuerſall Church, other Biſhops being but his Suffraganes or Deputies: ſuch an
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:23774:85"/> vniuerſall Biſhop is not the <hi>Pope;</hi> for excepting the ſpeciall points of his prerogatiues, he is not to intermedle with the particular buſineſſe of my other Biſhop within his Dioceſſe, no more then the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> is to deale with the gouernement of any other Biſhop vnder him, ſauing in caſes of his prerogatiue. But euen as it appertayneth vnto the Metropolitane to compoſe the controuerſies that may ariſe betweene the Biſhops of his Prouince, and to determine all ſuch cauſes as by appeale or otherwiſe belong vnto his court; to call a Prouinciall Councell, and to confirme the decrees of it, and to make Eccleſiaſticall Canons and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions for his Prouince: in like manner doth it appertayne vnto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Paſtor of the Church, to appeaſe and end all debates that ſhal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen betweene the Metropolitanes or Priuates; to judge of ſome ſuch matters of great moment, that may by appeale be very worthylie refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his court; to call generall Councels, and to be Preſident in them; to make Eccleſiaſticall lawes for the vvhole Church: in vvhich and ſuch like matters, the point of his Supremacy principally conſiſteth.

And if you make one vniuerſall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke, you depriue all the other Patriarkes of their title and dignity:</hi> l. 4. ep. 36. In this ſence tooke <hi>S.

               <p>The teſtimony of <hi>S.

               <p>But he returneth to <hi>Pope Gregory,</hi> who ſaith: <hi>That he was ſubject to the Emperours commandement: and had euery way diſchardged that which was due, in that be had performed his allegeance vnto the Emperour, and yet did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale what he thought in Gods behalfe.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, <hi>S.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:23774:86"/> his imperiall commandements,</hi> to be but an vſuall <hi>Italian</hi> phraſe. And vvith what congruity he citeth one of them to profeſſe obedience of curtefie to the Emperour, whome they account to haue beene no better then <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in his full pride, and to haue acknowledged no other man for his head,</hi> yea to haue extolled himſelfe aboue God, as they blaſpheme; I leaue it to the conſideration of the wiſe. Hitherto in anſwere of M. PERKINS objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> ſupremacy.</p>
               <p>It followed in due order, that hauing diſputed againſt that, he ſhould haue confirmed his owne opinion for the ſupremacy of Kings &amp; Princes: for it doth not followe neceſſarily, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> be not head of the Church, that then the King is; for Patriarkes or Primates may be in the ſeuerall Prouinces, or elſe the graue learned Senate of conſiſtoriall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and rude artificers, called (forſooth) <hi>Elders of the congregation.</hi> But M. PER. towardes the end of his booke waxeth ſlouthfull, and hath omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo to propoſe any arguments in our behalf; yea he doth not propoſe one reaſon in proofe of his owne poſition: Nay vvhich is moſt reproue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he doth in his owne arguments made againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> ſupremacy, vtterly ſubuert the Kinges ſupremacy, as you haue heard already in his firſt and fourth reaſons.

                  <hi>Nothing is to be beleeued as neceſſary to ſaluation, that is not written in the word of God: but it is not written any where in the new Teſtament, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt committed the gouernement of his Church vnto Kings or temporal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; therefore no ſuch thing is to be beleeued or taught by any Chriſtian.</hi> There is ſo little ſaid in fauour of their Supremacies in holy Scripture, that M.

Againe, if he ſpeake of temporall Magiſtrates, moſt aſſured it is that he meant nothing leſſe, then to counſaile the Chriſtians <hi>Romans</hi> to obey their Emperors (who were then <hi>Pagans</hi> and perſecutors) in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religion. The ſame anſwere will ſerue for their other text out of <hi>S. Peter,</hi>

Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> dayes were members of the Church, and much leſſe ſupreme heades in caſes Eccleſiaſticall: ſo that there is no vvarrant in all the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Kinges ſupremacy in matters of religion, and as little is there
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:23774:86"/> in the old, as ſhall be examined in due place; vvherefore not to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of any <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> And in very equity and true naturall light, how is it likely that temporall Princes both ſlenderly ſtudyed in matter of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and nothing practiſed in the manner of Eccleſiaſtical gouernement, ſhould be choſen as fitteſt perſons to decide all doubtes in Diuinity, and to order and determine all controuerſie in Church gouernement? or ſhall we thinke that our Sauiour had ſuch a ſimple fore-ſight, or ſlender care of his Church, as to commit it ſpecially to their chardge, vvho vvere both leaſt able, and moſt vnlikely to looke well vnto it? Women alſo and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be lawfull Kinges; but to make them ſupreme Gouernours of cauſes Eccleſiaſticall (vvherein children cannot, and vvomen may not ſpeake) is moſt ridiculous. And if all other proofes fayled, the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of our age were ſufficient to perſwade any reaſonable man, that it is moſt abſurd to be ruled by temporall Princes in matters of religion: for it would followe of it neceſſarily, that a Chriſtian were bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his conſcience to the Kinges lawes, and to embrace that religion which the King commandeth him, becauſe he is bound to obey his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior appointed by God. And conſequently my father for example, who liued in King <hi>Henryes</hi> the eight, King <hi>Edwardes,</hi> Queene <hi>Maryes,</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies, ſhould haue changed his religion foure times in his life, and that vvith a very good conſcience; becauſe he vvas ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe by the formall lawes of thoſe foure his temporall Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes: and ſo might without any offence to God, haue beene nowe of the old religion, then of the newe; and againe of neither old nor newe, but of a hotch-potch, and mingle-mangle of ſome of the one, and ſome of the other, vvhich is moſt abſurd: euen ſo is that of which it followeth.

It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth nowe that I briefly proue <hi>S. Peter</hi> to haue had this Supremacy in his time, and that therein the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> doe ſucceede him,</p>
               <p>And for a foundation of this Queſtion I take that for an aſſured truth, vvhich the beſt Philoſophers doe grant, and the practiſe of the beſt and greateſt Kingdome hath confirmed, to wit: <hi>That in one Kingdome it is beſt to haue one King and ſupreme gouernour, aſsiſted with the counſell of his wiſeſt ſubjects;</hi> which is ſo well knowne and confeſſed generally, that he muſt needes betaken for a vvrangler that will denie it: nowe then to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Chriſtes Church is but one ſtate or ſpirituall Kingdome, vvhich hath but one faith, one baptiſme and forme of Sacraments, one true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ſolemne manner of diuine ſeruice: Nowe ſeing vve are not to doubt, but that he (who purchaſed himſelfe this one Church, with the ſhedding of his owne moſt pretious bloud) would haue it gouerned in the beſt ſort; therefore we muſt confeſſe, that he hath ordayned one ſupreme Gouernour of it. They ſay, that this ſupreme Paſtor is Chriſt himſelfe, and that he is alwayes preſent with it in ſpirit, and by his word; vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there needeth no deputy, or other in his roome. This I haue once before confuted, graunting that Chriſt is preſent to his Church in ſpirit, and that he doth inwardly quicken and gouerne it: but that is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for vnleſſe we haue one certayne perſon viſibly preſent, to aſſure vs vvhich is the vvord of God, and what is the true ſence of all doubtfull places of it, we ſhall neuer haue vnity of faith: for if they who miſtake the true ſence, muſt be left to their owne judgement, and the direction of their owne ſpirit, which they beleeue to be guided with the holy Ghoſt; then ſhall vve haue ſo many hereſies currant in the Church, as there be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:23774:87"/> 
                  <hi>Archeretikes</hi> to coyne and ſtampe them. The like may be ſaid for Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſacred rites of religion, the which without one Supreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratour, cannot be kept vniforme: ſo that it reſteth moſt cleare, that our Sauiour Chriſt being to leaue this world and to returne vnto his heauenly Father, he was to commit the high charge of his only Spouſe and Doue, vnto the cuſtody and fidelity of one ſupreme Paſtor, This is confirmed by the example of the old Teſtament, vvhich vvas a figure of the newe,<note place="margin">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:23774:88"/> in the next ſentence there is no queſtion made, but that Chriſt did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Peter the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen,</hi> and not to reſerue them to himſelfe: therefore moſt certayne it is, that in the former ſentence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to build his Church vpon <hi>Peter.</hi> Finally, in the <hi>Syriake</hi> tongue (in vvhich our Sauiour then ſpake) it is ſo playne, that it cannot be doubted of: for it is, thou art <hi>Cephas,</hi> and vpon this <hi>Cephas</hi> I wil build my Church: nowe the vvord <hi>Cephas</hi> ſignifieth a rocke or ſtone.

Peter</hi> of all fault; holding it to haue beene but a ſet match betweene the two great Apoſtles, that one of them for the inſtruction of others, ſhould reprehend the other. But admitting with <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was worthy blame, and therefore juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by <hi>S. Paul;</hi> yet thence will followe no derogation to <hi>S. Peters</hi> dignity, but great commendation of his humility, as the holy Fathers of that opinion doe gather. Of it thus writeth <hi>S. Cyprian:</hi>

               <p>Firſt, that this Monarchy and ſoueraigne authority of one ouer all the reſt, vvas not to expire and end with <hi>S. Peter</hi> (as M. PER. dreameth) but to continue in Chriſtes Church vntill the end of the world, is cleare and euident to them vvho conſider, that this Supremacy was not giuen vnto <hi>S.

                  <hi>that a head being eſtabliſhed, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſchiſme and diuiſion might be preuented and taken away.</hi> If therefore it vvas thought neceſſary vnto the vviſdome of God, Chriſt IESVS, to appoint one head among the Apoſtles, and a fewe of the beſt Chriſtians (vvho had the firſt fruites of his holy ſpirit) to cut off diſſention, and to maintayne peace; how much more neede hath there beene euer ſithence, of one ſupreme Paſtor and moderatour of controuerſies, vvhen the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſtians is ſo greatly increaſed, and ſuch variety of nations are ingrafted &amp; incorporated into it? when through the diuerſity of wits and judgements and the decay of charity, there muſt needes be a thouſand times more neede of the ſupreme authority of ſome one, to hold all the reſt together in the vnity of faith and religion. Againe, in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and lawe of <hi>Moyſes</hi> (which was a figure of the new) the ſame forme of gouernement by one head and finall judge in ſpirituall matters, vvas at the firſt eſtabliſhed, and continued euer after vvithout alteration, till Chriſtes firſt comming: Euen ſo muſt the ſame Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchy (which our bleſſed Sauiour hath demiſed, framed, and founded) ſtand alwaies firme and inviolable, vntil his ſecond comming; for he hath built it vpon ſo firme <hi>a Rocke, that hell gates ſhall not preuaile againſt it:</hi> vvhich may be further confirmed, if we vveigh vvell of vvhat moment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it is, to alter and change the forme of gouernement. For it is of no leſſe moment, then to alter the whole eſtate of Chriſts common-weale; the very eſſence, forme, and vnity of a publike ſtate, conſiſting princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the manner and order of ruling of it: vvhich alteration and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to imagine to haue hapned in Chriſts Church, is to make many ſeames in his vnſowed garments, or rather to rippe it, and rent the vnity thereof into many peeces. It being therefore a moſt certayne truth, that the ſame ſupreme gouernement vvhich <hi>S. Peter</hi> had ouer the reſt, vvas to continue alwayes in Chriſtes Church; it followeth as plainely, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> vvere to ſucceede him in that ſoueraigne authority: for the very light of nature and common cuſtome of all nations doth teach vs; that he vvho ſucceedeth vnto another in any eſtabliſhed eſtate and calling, doth at his lawfull enſtalement therein, enter into ful poſſeſſion of al the rights, dignities, and priuiledges therevnto belonging. For example, vvhen one is crowned King of any nation, he preſently there vpon is endowed with al the power and prerogatiues, which his Predeceſſors in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome enjoyed before him. And to ſpeake of ſpirituall Prelates; vvho doubteth but that aſſoone as any Eccleſiaſtical perſon is choſen &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (for example) Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but that forth-with he is

Euen ſo the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding vnto <hi>S. Peter</hi> in that Apoſtolicall Sea, doe inherite and ſucceede him in that ſupreme authority, which Chriſt gaue vnto <hi>S. Peter,</hi> for to be continued in his Church vntill the worldes end. Now to auouch as ſome deſperately doe, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> did not die at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor neuer was at <hi>Rome;</hi> is ſo groſſe and palpable an vntruth, auerred by meere gheſſe and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, contrary to the euident teſtimony of all auncient fathers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto the expreſſe and ſenſible monuments of the place of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, of his reliques, and Churches (builded by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great to the perpetuall remembrance of them) in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet to this day moſt famouſly knowne through the world: this their aſſertion is (I ſay) ſo blockiſh and impudent, that it were but loſt time to ſtand about the proofe of it; for he that is ſo ſenceleſſe as to beleeue ſuch a paradoxe, deſerueth ſmall paynes for his recouery.</p>
               <p>But for an vpſhot of this queſtion, let vs heare the opinions of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Doctors of the Eaſt Church, who of all men are moſt likely not to attribute any ſuch ſupremacy vnto a Biſhop of the Weſt Church, if they had thought it due vnto any Patriarke of theirs, or if they had not judged it to be a cleare caſe in true Diuinity, that ſuch ſoueraigne authority was due vnto that one chiefe Paſtor in Gods Church.

               <p>
                  <hi>THe</hi> Catholikes <hi>teach, that the Sacraments are true and proper inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſes, which being moued by God thereunto, doe produce and giue grace to the worthy receiuer. Euen as the penne doth make the letter, or as the axe doth cut the wood, being thereto applyed by the workeman: ſo (for example) doth the Sacrament of baptiſme waſh away the ſinnes of the baptiſed, being by God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto ordayned, and rightly vſed by the Miniſter. But</hi> M. PERKINS holdeth, <hi>that the Sacraments haue no operation to that effect of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, but are only outward meanes, which being applyed vnto the party, God of himſelfe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:23774:93"/> doth immediately purge him from ſinne,</hi> and not by meanes of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Againe, <hi>Whereas we require a fit dispoſition in the receiuer to make him capable of the grace preſented, and exhibited vnto him, by the Sacrament;</hi> He holdeth, that all the vertue of the Sacrament conſiſteth in the receiuer, <hi>Who beholding thoſe ſignes from God in the handes of the Miniſter, muſt conceite and imagine: First, that God himſelfe by his owne mouth, doth promiſe him ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and by name, remiſsion of his ſinnes, the ſigne and pledge whereof, is that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; which the minde conſidering reaſoneth thus: he that vſeth the elements aright, in faith and repentance, ſhall receiue grace thereby; but I vſe the elements aright, therefore ſhall I receiue from God increaſe of grace. Thus then faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, not by the worke done, but by a kinde of reaſoning; the proofe whereof is borrowed from the elements, being ſignes and pledges of Gods mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contrarylie vve hold, that the Sacrament it ſelfe conferreth and doth giue great grace, ſo that there be no impediment or let of it, by reaſon of the receiuers euill diſpoſition. Now if the receiuer come throughly vvell prepared with great humility, charity, and attention, he then ouer and beſides the ordinary grace of the Sacrament, ſhall receiue more grace according vnto the meaſure of his owne preparation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas we teach the very grace of juſtification to be giuen in ſome Sacraments, as in Baptiſme and Penance, M. PER. ſaith no; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>A man of yeares must firſt beleeue, and be juſtified, before he can be a meete pertaker of any Sacrament.</hi> But vvhat vvill he then ſay vnto Infants? muſt not they receiue the grace of juſtification by Baptiſme, before they haue wit to beleeue, and to reaſon in ſuch ſort as he preſcribeth?</p>
               <p>Before I come vnto the arguments of either party, I thought fit to giue the reader to vnderſtand, that whether the Sacraments be true phyſicall inſtruments of grace or no,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Sacram. in gener. cap. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> is not a matter of faith, as <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> declareth; ſo we hold them to be true morall cauſes of the ſame grace: to which M. PER. yeelded his conſent; wherefore I will not be long in this queſtion. Secondly to perceiue well the ſtate of the queſtion, you muſt obſerue what difference there is betweene a <hi>phyſical</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> inſtrument. That then may be called a <hi>morall inſtrument,</hi> vvhich moueth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall agent to doe any thing, albeit he vſe not that thing it ſelfe as a meanes to doe it vvithall: ſo that if God be effectually moued to beſtowe grace vpon him that receiueth a Sacrament, by the ſight of the Sacrament, though he giue not the grace by the vvorke of the Sacrament, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from him felfe, the Sacrament is the morall meanes of the ſame grace; but it cannot be called the <hi>phyſicall</hi> or <hi>naturall inſtrument</hi> of that grace, vnleſſe God doe vſe and apply the Sacrament it ſelfe, as the meane and inſtrument to conuey the ſame grace into the ſoule of the receiuer.
<pb facs="tcp:23774:93"/> Nowe, vve hold it more agreable with the word of God and ſentences of the holy Fathers, and more for the dignity of the Sacraments themſelues, to ſay that God by them as by true naturall inſtruments, doth conuay his graces into our ſoule: M. PERKINS goeth about to proue the contrary, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The word preached, and the Sacraments doe differ in the manner of giuing Christ vnto vs, becauſe the word worketh by the eare, and the Sacraments by the eye: otherwiſe, for the giuing it ſelfe they differ not, Chriſt ſaying; that in the very word is eaten his owne fleſh: and what can be ſaid more of the Lordes ſupper?</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſaith, that beleeuers are pertakers of the body and bloud in baptiſme:</hi>

                  </gap>bia. <hi>Nowe vpon this it followeth, that ſeing the worke done in the word preached, conferreth not grace; neyther doth the worke done in the Sacrament conferre grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere that his owne firſt word muſt ſtand, wherein he ſaid <hi>that the word preached and the Sacraments doe differ in the manner of giuing vs Christes grace:</hi> for preaching doth by perſwaſion drawe vs vnto grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but the Sacraments as conduite-pipes, doe take and deriue grace from Chriſtes paſſion, and conuay it into the ſoules of all them, who doe not ſtoppe vp thoſe diuine conduits by their owne default, and want of due preparation. To his idle and ill ſhapen commation I anſwere, that Chriſtes body may be eaten two vvayes: either really as in the bleſſed Sacrament; or elſe ſpiritually, by beleeuing in Chriſt and being incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into his myſticall body: and in this ſecond ſort Infants in baptiſme, and all true beleeuers doe eate the body of Chriſt. But howe this proueth that the vvord and the Sacraments doe giue grace after the ſame manner, is there any man that can tell?</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> This is nothing to the purpoſe, for <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh there of preaching the Goſpell; and we treate here of miniſtring the Sacraments. Preaching (as hath beene ſaid) doth not conferre grace of it ſelfe, but by perſwaſion; no more doth the preacher, and ſo may be ſaid to be nothing in that worke of producing grace and faith in the hearer: but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conferring grace, he that adminiſtreth the Sacrament, doth really concurre as an inſtrument of producing the ſame grace.

               <p>M. PERKINS third reaſon: <hi>The Angels, nay the fleſh of the ſonne of God hath not any quickning vertue from it ſelfe, but all his vertue is from the God-head: nowe if there be no effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> This is too too ſimple; for a baſe bodily thing may conuay grace immediately, as an inſtrument of God, when as the higheſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath not power of it ſelfe to produce and conferre the ſame grace, as principall agent: as a meane ſubject by ſpeciall commiſſion and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Prince, may haue power of life and death; which the greateſt Peere in the realme hath not of his owne authority, without ſome priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the Prince.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> He miſtaketh greatly <hi>S.

Yea, he is ſo farre off from denying juſtification to be conferred by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that in the ſame epiſtle he teacheth vs to be juſtified by baptiſme, ſaying: <hi>We are buryed together with Chriſt by baptiſme into death,</hi>

                  <hi>that as he is riſen againe from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo we may walke in newneſſe of life.</hi> Againe, if Baptiſme be but a ſigne and ſeale of righteouſneſſe, how commeth the infant (that cannot for lacke of diſcretion beleeue) to that righteouſnes, whereof Baptiſme is the ſeale? <hi>Abraham</hi> in deede was juſtified before he vvas circumciſed, becauſe he vvas aboue 70. yeares old before he heard of any circumciſion; but thence it followeth not, that the infants (cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed at eight dayes old) vvere juſtified before they vvere circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And ſo it may be, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Captayne was juſtified, before he heard a word of the Sacrament of baptiſme, but that is nothing to proue or diſproue the ordinary vvorking of the Sacraments; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lawefull publication of any lawe, no man is bound to obſerue that lawe: ſo that <hi>Abraham</hi> before he had heard of circumciſion, and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> knowing nothing of Baptiſme, were not bound to them, but had other meanes of juſtification according to Gods vvill; and afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued thoſe Sacraments in obedience to God, both in teſtimony of their former righteouſneſſe, and to increaſe the ſame grace. Hence it doth not followe, but that the ordinary vvorking of both circumciſion and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme in infants, vvas and is, to purge them from originall ſinne, and to powre the grace of juſtification into their ſoules. But let vs admit al to be true which he ſaith, yet this argument helpeth not the maine point which he is to proue, to vvit; that <hi>the Sacraments doe not produce grace into our ſoules:</hi> for albeit they produced not the firſt juſtifying grace, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Alrar and ſome others doe not; yet they may truely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and worke in vs an encreaſe of Gods grace, and ſo be true phyſicall inſtrumentall cauſes of grace, according as the <hi>Catholikes</hi> hold.

               <p>M. PERKINS anſwereth, <hi>That ſaluation is aſcribed vnto the Sacraments as to the word of God, that is: as they are inſtruments to ſignifie, ſeale, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite to the beleeuing minde the fore-ſaid benefits, but indeede the proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby ſaluation is apprehended, is faith.</hi> And <hi>Sacraments are but props of faith, furthering ſaluation two wayes: Firſt, becauſe by their ſignification they helpe to nouriſh and preſerue faith. Secondly, becauſe they ſeale grace and ſaluation to vs; yea, God giueth grace and ſaluation vnto vs, when we vſe them well: ſo that we beleeue the word of promiſe made to the Sacrament, whereof they are ſeales.</hi> This his anſwere I haue put downe at large, that the juditious reader may ſee, howe many wordes he vſeth, to anſwere not one word to purpoſe; for here is indeede an explication of their owne doctrine, but not any reaſon, why we ſhould not take the wordes of holy Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleadged, according vnto the proper manner of the phraſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they aſſigne water to be the reall meanes, and true inſtrument of our ſaluation: and thus much of our firſt argument.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſhall directly confute his anſwere, thus: If Sacraments doe worke like vnto the word of God preached, and only exhibite and feale vnto the beleeuing minde, the benefits by them promiſed; then he that cannot vnderſtand ſuch ſignes and promiſes, and hath not vvit to conceiue and beleeue them, can in no caſe receiue any ſuch Sacrament well and worthily (as if the word were preached neuer ſo perfectly vnto one of no capacity or vnderſtanding, it would worke nothing with him, by reaſon of his want of vnderſtanding:) but the Sacrament of baptiſme and ſome others, giuen vnto them who haue not ſufficient wit and reaſon to vnderſtand the meaning of it, as (for example) vnto infants; yet doe neuertheleſſe worke their regeneration and ſaluation: therefore, it is moſt manifeſt and euident, that the Sacraments of their owne proper force, as the inſtruments of God doe worke our ſaluation, vvithout the helpe of the receiuers faith. This is confirmed by the teſtimony of thoſe auncient Fathers, who hold that one ſpeciall cauſe why our Sauiour would be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed was, that by touching the water, he might giue it vertue to purge and cleanſe vs from ſinne: ſo witneſſeth <hi>S.

And when we haue the teſtimony of auncient Councels, or of many holy Fathers, that theſe points of doctrine vvere by Tradition deliuered vnto the Church by the Apoſtles; vve as firmely beleeue them, as if they were written in the holy Scriptures. For which bookes of Scripture be Canonicall, vvhich not; and what is the true meaning of hard places in Scripture, we knowe no other way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty, then by the declaration of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church: which we therefore aſwell beleeue, telling vs theſe thinges were deliuered from
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:23774:97"/> the Apoſtles by Tradition, as thoſe thinges in vvriting. And that ſuch credit is to be giuen to the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, the Apoſtles Creede wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, which biddeth vs <hi>beleeue the Catholike Church.</hi> Nowe touching thoſe bookes of holy Scripture, vvhich vvere ſome hundreth yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt doubted off by ſome of the auncient Fathers, vvhether they were Canonicall or no, thus we ſay: That albeit it were vndetermined by the Church vntill <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> time, vvhether they were Canonical or no, and ſo were by diuers auncient Fathers, though not condemned as Apocryphall, yet not comprehended vvithin the Canon of aſſured Scriptures: notwithſtanding, that matter being in a Councell holden at <hi>Carthage</hi> (where among many other learned Biſhops <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> vvas preſent) throughly debated,<note place="margin">Concil. Cartag. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>47.</hi>
                  </note> thoſe bookes doubted off before, were found by the holy Ghoſt and them, to be true Canonicall Scripture; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vvere by the ſixt generall Councell (that confirmed this Councell holden at <hi>Carthage</hi>) declared and deliuered to the whole Church for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall. Nowe, as we receiued at the firſt the other bookes of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture, on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>edit of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church: euen ſo ought vve to doe theſe, ſhee hauing declared them to be ſuch; yea, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelues haue admitted many bookes of the newe Teſtament, vvhich vvere doubted off for three hundred yeares after Chriſt: why then doe they not as vvell receiue them of the old? The difference betwixt vs is, that they only of paſſion and priuate fancy admit theſe, and reject thoſe: vvhereas vve of obedience relying vpon the judgement of the vvhole Church, admit thoſe bookes for Canonicall, which the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church hath declared for ſuch. And thus much of the firſt concluſion.</p>
               <p>Nowe to the ſecond, <hi>touching ſaluation by Christ alone,</hi> wherein the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> either cannot vnderſtand, or will not report our doctrine aright. We confeſſe that Chriſt IESVS hath merited the redemption and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all mankinde; yet ſay we further, that not one man is ſaued through Chriſt, vnleſſe he for his owne part firſt beleeue in Chriſt, if he be of yeares, and be content to doe all thoſe thinges that Chriſt hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to doe: ſo that to ſaluation two thinges are required, the firſt and principall is Chriſtes mediation, the ſecond is the applying of Chriſtes mediation and merits vnto vs; vvithout this latter, the former will ſtand no man in ſteede. Nowe to be made partaker of Chriſts merits, we muſt not only beleeue in him as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> teach, but alſo keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and by good workes deſerue heauen; otherwiſe according to Chriſts decree, we ſhall neuer come thither, as in the queſtion of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits hath beene plentifully proued out of the holy ſcriptures: ſo we teach then, that beſides Chriſts ſufferings and merits we muſt haue ſome of our
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:23774:97"/> owne, or elſe vve ſhall neuer be partakers of Chriſtes.</p>
               <p>And M. PERKINS cannot be excuſed from a vvilfull corruption of Gods word, when he affirmeth <hi>S. Paul</hi> to ſay; <hi>We are not ſaued by ſuch workes as God hath ordayned men regenerated to walke in:</hi> for thoſe be not the wordes of the text, but his peeuiſh conſtruction, <hi>S. Paul</hi> putting a playne diſtinction betweene <hi>workes that we are not ſaued by, and workes that we muſt walke in;</hi> calling theſe later <hi>good workes,</hi> and the other barely <hi>workes.</hi> To the other text I ſay, that we haue no righteouſneſſe of our owne ſtrength, or by the vertue of <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawe; but through the mercy of God, and Chriſts merits, we haue true righteouſneſſe giuen vs by baptiſme. Chriſt indeede by himſelfe and his owne ſufferinges, not by ſacrifice of Goates or Calues, hath <hi>meritoriouſly waſhed</hi> away our ſinnes, that is: deſerued of God that they ſhould be waſhed away; but <hi>formally</hi> he hath waſhed away our ſinnes by infuſion of Chriſtian righteouſneſſe into our ſoules. He that will ſee more of this, let him reade the queſtion of Iuſtification. And where as M. PER. ſaith, that all grace of God powred into our hartes, is by the corruption of our hartes defiled; he little knoweth the vertue of Gods grace, vvhich ſo cleanſeth and purifieth our hart and ſoule, that it maketh it <hi>whiter then ſnowe, the temple of the holy Ghost,</hi>

                  <hi>ſanctified and apt to all good workes;</hi> as the word of God witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>The third concluſion is about <hi>Chriſtes imputatiue justice:</hi> vve hold that no man is formally juſtified by that juſtice which is in Chriſt, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and vvould make vs as juſt as Chriſt himſelfe is; but that God through Chriſtes merits, doth beſtowe vpon euery righteous man a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne meaſure of juſtice, vvherewith his ſoule being purged from ſinne, and adorned with all honeſty, fit for his degree and calling, is made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in Gods ſight, and worthy of the Kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS holdeth, that <hi>Euery juſt man hath faith created in his hart, whereby he layeth hand on Chriſtes juſtice, and drawing that to himſelfe, maketh it his owne.</hi> He proueth it by theſe wordes of the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt is made vnto vs of God, Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere, that Chriſt is in that place ſo made our <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> as he is made our <hi>wiſdome:</hi> nowe no man holdeth that he is made our wiſdome by imputation, therefore is he not our righteouſneſſe by imputation. The Apoſtles meaning is, that Chriſt is the procurer and meritorious cauſe of both our wiſdome and juſtice, and of whatſoeuer other ſpirituall gifts we enjoy. And this righteouſneſſe which God beſtoweth on vs in this life, is ſufficient to enable vs to keepe Gods lawe, (as I haue proued in ſeuerall queſtions before) and to make vs worthy of life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>The fourth concluſion: Catholikes <hi>hold it the ſureſt courſe, to put their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23774:98"/> truſt in the mercy of God and merits of Christ for their ſaluation: yet in ſobri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> they may haue confidence both in their owne merittes, and in other good mens prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, becauſe God ſaueth none of yeares, who doe not merit life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting by vſing his grace well: therefore a vertuous honeſt man, may haue ſome confidence in the good courſe of his life. Marry, becauſe we are not throughly aſſured of our owne good workes paſt; neither can we tell howe long we ſhall perſeuer in that Godly courſe of life: therefore, vve rather ſtand in feare, when we conſider our owne vvorkes, and our whole confidence is in the mercies of God, vvho for Chriſtes ſake calleth moſt vnworthy creatures to his grace, and doth neuer for ſake any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to continue in his ſeruice. Neyther doth that viſitation of the ſicke in the Dutch tongue, found in a duſty corner, any whit helpe them: for we teach all (eſpecially notorious ſinners that vvallowe in ſinne vntill their dying day, ſuch as it ſeemeth that viſite was made for) to truſt, not in their owne naughtineſſe or little goodnes, vvho haue a hundreth times more euill then good in them; but in the infinite mercy of God and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable merits of our Sauiours death and paſſion: vvhich letteth not but that a good man may haue ſome confidence in his owne merits, and in the prayer of Saints. And M PER. conſidereth little what he ſaith, vvhen he affirmeth, <hi>That we make that our God, in which we put our truſt:</hi> for albeit vve muſt truſt only in God, as in the author of all good thinges; yet may vve truſt in diuers other thinges, as in the meanes of our ſaluation. Doe not the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> truſt in Chriſtes paſſion? and yet I hope they made not his paſſion their God. Haue they not a confidence and truſt in their liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith? yes, I vvarrant you, or elſe they would not be farre from deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: ſo notwithſtanding his vaine babling, <hi>Catholikes</hi> vvell grounded in vertue, may haue ſome confidence in their owne good deedes, and in the prayer of Saints, as orderly meanes to attayne vnto ſaluation, albeit vve truſt in God only, as in the authour of it.</p>
               <p>The fift and laſt concluſion, <hi>That we must not only beleeue in generall, the promiſes of life euerlaſting, but apply them to vs in particular by hope.</hi> M. PER. ſomewhat faintly excepteth againſt this, and ſaith: <hi>That by faith we must aſſure our ſelues of our ſaluation preſent, and by hope continue the certainety of it.</hi> Marry, he addeth further, <hi>That they teach not that euery man liuing within the precincts of their Church, is certayne of his ſaluation by faith; but that he ought ſo t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be, and muſt endeauour to attayne thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then, that man hath not the faith of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> vvhich cannot but apply vnto themſelues in particular the promiſes of life euerlaſting; and that as the nature of faith requireth, without all ſtaggering &amp; doubt:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:23774:98"/> but to ſowe pillowes, and to lay them vnder poore deceiued mens el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes he ſometimes ſaith, that he requireth not ſuch certainety of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet in the concluſion of this very Chapter he forgetting himſelfe ſo quickly, ſaith: <hi>That we aboliſh the ſubſtance of faith, namely in denying the particular certayne application of Christ crucified, and his benefits vnto our ſelues.</hi> A vvorthy authour, that can no better agree with himſelfe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt concluſion. <hi>Repentance is the conuerſion of a ſinner; which is twofold, paſsiue and actiue: paſsiue is an action of God, whereby he conuerteth a ſinner.

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond concluſion. <hi>That repentance ſtandeth ſpecially for practiſe, in contrition of hart, confeſsion of mouth, and ſatisfaction in worke or deede. There be two ſortes of contrition; one, when a man is ſorrowfull for feare only of hell, and other puniſhments in this life:</hi> this he calleth <hi>legall,</hi> though in the ſtate of the lawe there was moſt perfect contrition in ſome: <hi>The other Euangelicall, when one is greeued for his ſinnes, not ſo much for feare of hell, as becauſe he hath offended ſo good and mercyfull a God; which is alwayes neceſſary. Secondly, We hold confeſsion neceſſary to be made, firſt to God, then publikely to the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, if any man be excommunicate for any crime. Thirdly, To our neighbour, when we haue offended and wronged him. Laſtly, In all true repentance there must be ſatisfaction made: Firſt to God, by intreating him to accept of Chriſtes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our ſinnes. Secondly, to the Church for publike offences, in humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to teſtifie the truth of our repentance.

               </p>
               <p>The third concluſion. <hi>That in repentance, we are to bring forth outward fruites, worthy amendment of life: whereof the principall is, to endeauour day and night by Gods grace to leaue and renounce al and euery ſinne, and in all thinges to doe the will of God.</hi>

               <head>THE DIFFERENCE.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE diſſent not from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in the doctrine of repentance it ſelfe, but in the abuſes thereof: firſt in generall, becauſe they beginne repentance part of the holy Ghoſt, and part of themſelues, by the power of their free will helped by the holy Ghoſt;</hi>

                  <hi>whereas</hi> Paul <hi>aſcribeth it wholy vnto God, prouing if God at any time will giue them repentance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Of this point hath beene ſpoken in the queſtions of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvill, and of Iuſtification: and here M.

And where he ſaith, that the ſinner was before dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not moue any part towardes repentance: we anſwere, that the grace of God rayſing him to repentance, doth quicken him and enable him to doe that good worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond abuſe of miſtaking of penance, for the correction only of notorious offenders,</hi> is a fable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third abuſe</hi> (ſaith M.

Yea, it ſeemeth that</hi> Lumbard <hi>was one of the firſt, that called it a Sacrament: and the Schoole-men after him disputed of the matter and forme of this Sacrament, not able any of them certainely to define, what ſhould be the outward element of it.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> When there is no mention made of faith, but only of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to attribute all to faith and nothing to repentance, is a very extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant gloſſe; ſpecially he doing it of his owne authority, without warrant eyther of reaſon or of any authour: and thus much of the abuſes (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) of repentance in generall. Nowe to the particular, about Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Confeſſion, and Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt abuſe concerning contrition is, that the</hi> Catholikes <hi>teach that it muſt be ſufficient and perfect: they vſe to helpe the matter by a diſtinction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>O remarkeable abuſe, that <hi>Catholikes</hi> vvould haue contrition to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and perfect! If vve vvould haue had it imperfect, and not fit to ſerue the turne, then loe we had hitte the nayle on the head: what dotage is this? vve ſay briefly concerning ſorrowe for our ſinnes paſt; firſt, that it ought to be the greateſt that we can haue: for nothing is vvorthy to be ſo vehemently lamented, as that vve haue deadly offended our creatour and redeemer, and are fallen from his grace, into the ſlauery of our moſt deadly enemy the Deuill; ſo that for this, as for the greateſt euill that could be fall vs, we are to be moſt ſorrowfull. And this higheſt degree of

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, vvhen thereby alone vve doe recouer the grace of God: but vvhen Contrition is joyned vvith Confeſſion, and is made a part of the Sacrament, then loe though it vvere not ſo great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as is otherwiſe requiſite, it receiueth by vertue of participating with Chriſtes grace in that Sacrament, the full meaſure of ſorrowe, and ſo is made vp ſufficient and perfect; vvhich M. PER<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calleth the firſt abuſe of Contrition, but goeth not about to diſproue it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>is, that we aſcribe to Contrition, the merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before he ſticked not to ſay that vve made repentance the meritorious cauſe of remiſſion of ſinnes; vvhich vvas a loude lie, becauſe vve teach that no man can merit remiſſion of his ſinnes: for no man can merit ought at Gods handes, vnleſſe he firſt be in his grace and fauour, vvhich no ſinner is; vvherefore we hold only, that repentance as faith, hope, and a purpoſe of amendment, be only good diſpoſitions, making the man fit and apt to receiue the grace of juſtification, vvhich God freely of his infinite mercy without any deſert of ours, beſtoweth vpon vs only for Chriſtes ſake. That apt diſpoſition ſome men call merit of congruity; vvherein is no deſert of the grace giuen, but only a man is made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more meete and better prepared to receiue ſuch grace. Nowe mans merits doe ſo vvell agree and ſtand vvith Chriſtes merits, that Chriſtes order is, that none comming to the age of diſcretion, ſhall be partaker of his merits, vnleſſe he by his owne merits doe make himſelfe capable of them, as hath beene ſufficiently proued before in the queſtion of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>The third abuſe, <hi>That they make imperfect contrition or attrition ariſing of the feare of hell, to be good and profitable, and to it they apply the ſaying of the Prophet, The feare of God is the beginning of wiſdome.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:23774:101"/> Nowe to the abuſes concerning Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The firſt abuſe, <hi>That we confeſſe our ſinnes to God in an vnknowne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What, is there any language vnknowne to God? or doth he meane, that the vnlearned make their confeſſion in <hi>Latin?</hi> which is impoſſible for a man that vnderſtandeth not one <hi>Latin</hi> vvord. He vvould ſay (I gheſte) that ſome of them begin their generall confeſſion in <hi>Latin,</hi> but we ſpeake here of euery mans confeſſion in particular: that general of the Churches ordinance, is commanded only to be vſed of them that are skilfull in the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue; all others may vſe the <hi>Engliſh. Withall</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we require the ayde and interceſsion of dead men.</hi> We beleeue the Saints to be liuing, which if he doth not he blaſphemeth. Touching the interceſſion of Saints I haue treated before. Nowe as we requeſt the helpe of their prayers, ſo doe we acknoweledge vnto them howe grieuouſly vve haue offended, that they ſeing our humility and ſorrowe for our ſinnes, may the more earneſtly entreate for the remiſſion of them. But let vs come vnto the principall point in controuerſie about this matter, viz. <hi>That we haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Canonicall confeſsion, by turning it into a priuate auricular confeſsion, binding all men to confeſſe all their mortall ſinnes, with the circumſtances that change the kinde of the ſinne (as farre as they can remember) once euery yeare at the leaſt; and that to a Prieſt, vnleſſe it be in the caſe of extreame neceſsity: but in the word of God there is no warrant for this confeſsion, nor in the writinges of orthodoxe antiquity for the ſpace of many hundreth yeares after Christ; as one of their owne ſide auoucheth:</hi> and he quoteth in the margent a man of ſmall credit among vs <hi>Beatus Rhenanus,</hi> for his authour. Well let vs ſee a little, vvhat warrant we haue in holy Scriptures and in the auncient Doctors, for confeſſion of our faultes vnto a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is euidently collected out of theſe wordes of our Sauiour: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the holy Ghoſt,</hi>

                  <hi>whoſe ſinnes yee doe forgiue in earth, they ſhall be forgiuen in heauen, and whoſe ſinnes yee doe retayne, they ſhall be retayned.</hi> For giuing his Apoſtles power to remit and forgiue men their ſinnes, his meaning vvas not that they ſhould pardon them whether they would or would not, or that they ſhould abſolue any other then ſuch as vvere contrite, and did humbly craue abſolution: neyther ſhould they abſolue them from they knewe not of what, but that they ſhould knowe vvhat, howe many and howe grieuous their offences were, that they might be put to worthy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and receiue particular comfort and counſell for the amendment of their liues; or elſe they ſhould be the moſt fooliſh judges, that euer vvere appointed vpon earth. Wherefore, ſeing that the Apoſtles had authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to forgiue ſinnes, and vvere in diſcretion to admmiſter the ſame vnto
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:23774:101"/> penitent ſinners; it muſt needes followe neceſſarily, that the penitent ſhould confeſſe all his ſinnes in particular vnto them: and that authority was to continue in the Church for euer, it being giuen to the Apoſtles for the due gouerning of the Church, and to the comfort of al ſinners; which ſhould neuer fayle to be vntill Chriſtes laſt comming to judgement. They to defeate all this diſcourſe, anſwere: <hi>That Christ gaue not his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles authority to pardon any mans ſinnes, but only to declare that their ſinnes were pardoned, if with true repentance and faith they receiued the preaching of the Gospell.</hi> This interpretation firſt is repugnant to the text, vvhich in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tearmes hath, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes yee ſhall remit</hi> or pardon; not vvhoſe ſinnes yee ſhall declare to be remitted. Secondly it hath, that <hi>Whoſe ſinnes yee ſhall forgiue, they are forgiuen,</hi> to wit: euen then, when they remit them, and not that they were remitted before; as he ſhould haue ſaid, if he had giuen them authority only to declare them to be remitted. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the metaphor of keyes giuen vnto them, doth demonſtrate that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was giuen them to abſolue, and not to declare only they were abſolued; becauſe keyes are giuen to open or ſhut dores, and not to ſignifie that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dores are already open, or ſhall be vpon condition. Laſtly, the Miniſters pronouncing of men abſolued, ſhould be very raſh and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous if they doe not truly abſolue them. For if he pronounce them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be abſolued without good aſſurance of their faith &amp; repentance, he ſhould but lie: and if he doe pronounce them abſolued conditionally if they beleeue aright and be truly penitent, then vvere his abſolution in vaine; for it depending vpon their faith and repentance, and not vpon the Miniſters pronouncing, it bringeth no further aſſurance then they had before: yea, they themſelues being of the faithfull, could not be ignorant of ſo much before, to wit, that he was free from ſinne, and needed not his abſolution. Nowe that the Apoſtles then, and Biſhops, and Prieſts their ſucceſſours euer ſithence, did truly abſolue men from their ſinnes, and were not (like to cryers) only proclaymers thereof, ſee firſt <hi>S.

                  <hi>which God would neuer giue to Angels,</hi> who yet had power to pronounce ſaluation to penitent ſinners. Secondly, <hi>That Priestes haue ſuch power of binding and looſing ouer the ſoules, as Kinges haue ouer their ſubjects bodyes;</hi> vvhich is truly to binde or to looſe them, and not only to declare them bound or looſed. Thirdly, he ſaith expreſly: <hi>That the Prieſtes among the</hi> Iewes <hi>had power to purge the leproſie, or rather to try whether they were purged from it or no; but it is graunted vnto our Priestes, not only to diſcerne whether the body be purged from leproſie or no, but playnely to purge our ſoules from the filth of ſinne.</hi>

And in right reaſon, can there be any better bridle vnto our corrupt nature, then the very ſhame and baſhfulneſſe of confeſſing our ſecret faultes vnto a learned, good, and graue man, ſuch as a Confeſſour is or ſhould be? Againe, where true confeſſion of ſinnes is, there men vſe the beſt meanes that can be, to driue them from the cuſtome of ſinning: for beſides the particular ſorrow which they haue of their ſinnes, they muſt firmely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe neuer to returne to any kinde of ſinne afterward; yea, they muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne from all occaſions alluring to ſinne: ſo that no man (vſing wel this Sacrament of Confeſſion) can dwell in malice, vſury, leachery, or any ſtate of ſinne. Moreouer, if they haue taken away the goodes or good name of their neighbour, they are enjoyned in confeſſion preſently to doe their beſt to reſtore it backe againe. Theſe and many other great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities being the inſeperable companions of priuate Confeſſion, vve <hi>Catholikes</hi> doe attribute vnto the good vſe thereof, the greateſt Godlines and deuotion that is amongſt vs. And no maruaile, though our common
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23774:104"/> enemy doe ſo buſily endeauour to withdrawe ſinners from it, amplifying vnto them the indignity and ſhame of it: but if they would conſider ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely, that dying in their ſinnes for lacke of due confeſſion, they ſhal be (to their vtter ſhame and confuſion) made to confeſſe them all and euery one at the latter day, before God, all his Angels and Saints, the Deuill and all damned ſoules being alſo preſent; they would vndoubtedly make choiſe, rather to confeſſe their ſinnes to ſome one vertuous Prieſt, vvho will neuer reueale them, but in Chriſtes name abſolue and pardon them; then to leaue them to that dreadfull day of Gods juſt judgements, when beſides the ſhame and confuſion of them, no pardon is to be hoped for. And thus much touching Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly (ſaith M. PERKINS) <hi>The abuſe of ſatisfaction is, that they haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Canonicall ſatisfaction, which was made to the congregation by open offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, into a ſatisfaction of the justice of God, for the temporall puniſhment of their ſinnes. Behold here a moſt horrible prophanation of the whole Goſpell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Behold here a moſt vngodly and ſenceleſſe out-crye what, doth the whole ſanctity of the Goſpell conſiſt only in the point of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? it is too too abſurd ſo to ſay. And howe knoweth he, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall ſatisfaction</hi> vvas only or principally to ſatisfie the congregation? They that ordayned of old thoſe Canons of ſatisfaction, had a greater care to ſatisfie and appeaſe the wrath of God juſtly incenſed againſt ſuch wicked offendors; then to ſatisfie men: but this prophane man very fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreameth, that they rather ſought to pleaſe men then God. But of this matter there is a vvhole queſtion in the former part: there he that vvill may ſee, howe all ſatisfactions are principally inſtituted to appeaſe Gods wrath, and that they doe apply vnto vs the ſatisfactions of Chriſt, and make vs partakers of them, and are beſides moſt conuenient meanes to bridle out corrupt nature from all ſorts of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS to ſhewe that he vvas the ſame man in the end of his booke, as in the beginning; concludeth this part with a moſt palpable lie, to wit: <hi>That Priests are not put to death in</hi> England <hi>for their religion, but for their treaſons which they intend and enterpriſe.</hi> Let their owne recordes be ſeene, whether very many of them haue not beene condemned, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Prieſtes, made after the auncient <hi>Roman</hi> manner, without laying vnto their charge any enterpriſe, eyther againſt the perſon of the Prince, or peace of the State. But what wil not a Miniſter auouch to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace poore Prieſtes, vvho doe neuertheleſſe not only pray, but vvill be ready alſo to ſpend their bloud for the conuerſion of men of his ſort, and for all others their deare country-men, by them moſt pitteouſly ſeduced.</p>
               <p>Hitherto M. PERKINS hath handled pointes of religion, ſomething
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:23774:104"/> like a ſchoole-man: now like a pulpit-miniſter he goeth on with his text, and maketh ſuch an vnſauory gloſſe vpon it, that it loathes me almoſt to looke on it: yet becauſe he raketh and heapeth togither all the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter that he can deuiſe againſt vs, I will giue it the whippe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily runne ouer it: thus he beginneth.</p>

                  <hi>that the true Church of God is, and hath beene in the preſent</hi> Roman <hi>Church, as the corne in the heape of chaffe.

                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Here is a proper peece of doctrine, and proued as profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is very ridiculous and abſurd to ſay, that their Church vvas in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for one that wil be both of their Church &amp; of the <hi>Roman,</hi> muſt beleeue and profeſſe not one or two, but more then twenty articles flat contradictory the one to the other, which is impoſſible. Can a man at once beleeue the <hi>Pope</hi> to be head of the vniuerſal Church, and with-all ſweare that he hath no authority in many Prouinces of it, but that all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall juriſdiction there belongeth to the Prince? or that Chriſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, is really preſent in the Sacrament, and not really preſent? and that Saints are to be prayed vnto, and not to be prayed vnto? nothing is more euident, then that this cannot be: no more could the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Church be in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> vvould allowe them for theirs, vvho beleeue moſt of the articles of the <hi>Roman</hi> faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their owne doctrine, ſo that in ſome fewe points they doe agree and accord with them: yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wil neuer take them for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her children, who doe not wholy and inuiolably hold all the points of faith that ſhe profeſſeth; but renounceth them, and declareth them to be accurſed: wherefore, no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can be in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But they ſay, <hi>That their Church lay hidde in the</hi> Roman, <hi>as corne in chaffe.</hi> Did it in deede lie in ſuch obſcurity, that none of them were to be ſeene or heard off? therefore it was no Church at all: for the moſt proper markes of the Church (according to their owne principles) are, <hi>The true preaching of Gods word, and the ſincere adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</hi> Nowe, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the vvord muſt be both ſeene and heard alſo; and they walked not inuiſible (I hope) vvho miniſtred and receiued their Sacraments:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:23774:105"/> wherefore, they muſt either graunt that their Church in that generall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy was viſible, or that it was no Church at all, as not hauing the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable markes of their Church, which are, <hi>The true preaching of the word,</hi> and <hi>due administration of the Sacraments.</hi> Againe, if they had beene liuely members of the true Church, how could they liue vnknowne in that great Apoſtacy? were they not bound in conſcience, to haue made profeſſion of their faith publikely?<note place="margin">

                  <hi>If any man aske them where their Church was before</hi> Luthers <hi>dayes, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of this text,</hi> (Goe out of her my people,) <hi>that it was euer ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes.</hi>

               <p>Let vs drawe this to ſome forme of argument, that it may appeare how it hangeth togither: A voice from heauen cryed in <hi>S.

Apply <hi>Iohn Barber,</hi> and thou ſhalt haue a newe paire of ſizors for thy labour. Should not a man leeſe his labour to confute particularly ſuch a ſenceleſſe diſcourſe? But yet a word to his next annotation vpon the text: <hi>Demanding whether the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>he a Church or no?</hi> he anſwereth, <hi>That (if it be ſo taken as in truth it is) it is no Church at all.</hi> His proofes are, <hi>That it is</hi> Babilon, <hi>that it peruerteth the true ſence of the Scripture, and ouerturneth the inward baptiſme:</hi> all which I haue heretofore confuted.

               <p>Wherefore, omitting ſuch impertinent ſtuffe, let vs come vnto thoſe horrible crimes that he chargeth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> withall.

               <p>But <hi>we make the bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>a Mediator of redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fie vpon ſuch an impudent face: but <hi>we call her a Lady, a Queene:</hi> be it ſo. For ſo did <hi>Athanaſius in Euang. de ſanctiſs.

                  <hi>A mediatreſſe of interceſsion, our hope, our life,</hi> and the like, ſhee may be called in a good ſence; becauſe we hope through the helpe of her moſt gratious prayers to obtayne the life of our ſoules: and ſo may it be ſaid to her, <hi>Prepare thou glory for vs, defend vs from our enemies,</hi> and ſuch like, to wit, by the meanes of her prayers. <hi>Againe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their Idolatry is manifeſt, in that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in, at, or before Images.</hi> Then are the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alſo Idolaters, becauſe they vvorſhip God, in, or at the Churches; at, or before their
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:23774:106"/> communion table. Whether we haue commandement or not for Images, maketh nothing to Idolatry; but whether we giue to Images the honour only due to God, which we doe not. Nowe to compare Images to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, is to dote; and deſerueth no anſwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their Idolatry paſſeth the Idolatry of the</hi> Heathens, <hi>in that they worſhip a breaden God, or Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O impious <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and altogither vnworthy the name of a Chriſtian! Is not Chriſt to be worſhipped whereſoeuer he be? and that as wel vnder the formes of bread, as vnder the ſhape of a man? it is not the outward ſhape or ſhewe, that maketh Chriſt worthy of diuine worſhip: but the ſubſtance of his God-head there preſent though hidden. <hi>But he is not there at all</hi> ſaith he: vvhich to be moſt falſe, I haue proued in that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third ſinne is the maintaynance of adultery, first in the tollerating of the ſtewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> It is one thing to tollerate an euil, another thing to maintaine it. God doth tollerate many euils, but maintayneth none: ſo the ſtewes in ſome hotte Countryes are tollerated, to auoide a greater miſchiefe; yet not maintayned but diſgraced and puniſhed, and diuers meanes vſed to perſwade them that liue ſo viciouſly, to leaue and deteſt that vvicked kinde of life. As our ſtate doth tollerate vſury, if it be vnder tenne in the hundreth: and yet we charge them not with maintaynance of vſury, but rather thinke it a politike deuiſe, by tollerating the leſſe euill to auoyde a greater. Againe, this is a point of ciuill pollicy, and no part of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> religion, which is in many Kingdomes wholy embraced, where there be no ſtewes tollerated. In ſome hotte Countryes the ciuill Magiſtrate by experience findeth it better, to ſuffer ſome hot and incontinent leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous companions to haue ſuch a remedy, rather then to permit them to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit their Wiues and Daughters to vvickedneſſe. I would to God that the wiſe ſaying of a moſt worthy Doctor were not fulfilled in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: <hi>Take away the ſtewes, and fill all the City with adultery.</hi> Is not the City of <hi>London</hi> vvell reformed (trowe you) by taking the ſtewes out of it? if the man had any fore-head, knowing howe their ſweet Goſpell hath infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted both Court and Country vvith filthy and abhominable lechery, he would haue beene aſhamed to reprehend them, who labour to breake the worſer courſe of it, ſeing they cannot extinguiſh it altogether.</p>
               <p>He ſaith ſecondly, <hi>That our lawe alloweth marriage beyond the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and by this meanes incest: for</hi> Anne <hi>the Aunt of</hi> Nicholas <hi>may be marryed vnto the child of</hi> Nicholas <hi>childes child, becauſe ſhee is beyond the fourth degree.</hi>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:23774:106"/> before that child of the fourth generation after <hi>Nicholas</hi> her Nephewe, be marryageable? by that he be twenty yeares old, ſhee muſt be ſix-ſcore or there about, and ſo a very fit match for that youth. Againe, it is but a ſuppoſed imagination of a rawe head, that the Aunt is in ſteede of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto all that deſcend of her Brother. Theſe good fellowes that finde fault with vs, for allowing mariage beyond the fourth degree, doe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues maintayne it in the very ſecond; for brother and ſiſters children may and doe often marry together among them: which was prohibited in <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> dayes as a deformity,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>15.</hi> de ciuit. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> euen againſt the naturall ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe ingrafted in ſo neare of kinne. And <hi>Gregory</hi> the great being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded at the firſt conuerſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the faith, his opinion in this matter, anſwereth thus:<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>6.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Aug. ad Greg.</note> 
                  <hi>That although a certaine earthly lawe permitted brothers children to match together; yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we haue by experience obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that iſſue proceedeth not of ſuch mariage: and the holy Scripture teacheth vs, that we may not reueale the turpitude of our kindred.</hi> Whence he concludeth, that euen thoſe newely conuerted Chriſtians (to whome he graunted as great fauour as he might) ſhould vvholy abſtayne from mariage in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree: ſo that brethrens children marying according to their new doctrine, contrary to the auncient Canons of the Church, doe liue in perpetual inceſt, and their children be no better then baſtardes; it is they then that allowe inceſt, and not we. In another caſe, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by their doctrine and practiſe doe confirme and ratifie adultery: for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent party (for example the Husband) taking his Wife in adulterie, doth not only put her away by diuorſe, but may alſo marry another, his former wife yet liuing; vvhich to be playne adultery no meaner a learned man then <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> twelue hundred yeares paſt hath moſt ſoundly proued, and that out of the expreſſe word of God: and therefore did he intitle that his treatiſe, <hi>De adulterinis conjugijs, of adulterous mariages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth ſinne of</hi> Papiſts <hi>is magicke, ſorcery, and witchcraft, in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of their Hoſt, and in making holy bread and holy water and ſuch like; and by driuing out of the Deuill by the ſigne of the croſse, by exorciſmes and ringing of bels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For theſe thinges haue no force eyther by their creation, or by any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> If it be ſorcery and vvitch-craft to conſecrate the body of Chriſt (which is done by due pronunciation of Chriſts wordes) then was Chriſt the author of that ſorcery, and he himſelfe that firſt conſecrated it, a ſorcerer, which only to inſinuate is moſt damnable. See what wicked enemies of Chriſt we haue vnder the habite of Miniſters: and what a log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-headed lie is it, to ſay that we haue no warrant in Gods word for the bleſſing of bread, water, oyle, and ſuch like? when <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That all
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:23774:107"/> things are ſanctified and made holy by the word of God and prayer.</hi>

And as for bels, they being dedicated to the ſeruice of God, for the aſſembling of his people togither to worſhip him, and hauing many deuout prayers ſaid ouer them to that purpoſe; vve doubt not but that the very ſound of them is terrible to the enemies of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioſue</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</note> as being the trumpets of his army.

               <p>
                  <hi>The fift ſinne is perjury, which they maintayne; becauſe they teach that a</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt <hi>examined, may anſwere doubtfully againſt the intention of the examiner, framing another meaning to himſelfe. As for example, when a man is asked, whether he ſaid or heard</hi> Maſſe <hi>in ſuch a place, though he did, he may ſay that he did not, and ſweare to it, meaning he was not there to reueale it to him; whereas in the law of nature he that taketh an oath, ſhould ſweare according vnto the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him that hath power to miniſter an oath, and that in truth, juſtice, and judgement. Let them cleare their doctrine from all defence of perjury, if they can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> If he had cited but one author, you ſhould haue heard a ful ſatisfaction of this matter: The truth is, that ſwearing a truth in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſweareth it, although it be againſt the intention of him that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth the oath, may be lawfully vſed in two caſes. The firſt, if he that miniſtreth the oath, haue not ſufficient authority to miniſter it. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, when hauing authority he asketh ſomething beyond the order of lawe, and againſt juſtice; then he that ſweareth is excuſed by the rule touched by M. PERK. himſelfe, becauſe a man muſt ſweare as in truth, ſo in juſtice, that is, to doe or ſay nothing againg juſtice. And ſo when one enquireth after ſaying or hearing <hi>Maſſe,</hi> as of a haynous crime, to puniſh good Chriſtians for it, the man is bound not to reueale it, as being againſt true juſtice, to make his neighbour puniſhed for ſo holy a fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſixt ſinne is, that they reuerſe many of Gods Commandements, making that no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſinne which Gods word maketh a ſinne: for example, If one ſteale ſome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:23774:107"/> little thing that cauſeth no notable hurt, that is no mortall ſinne;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Molanus.</note> 
                  <hi>and a merry or officious lie is but a veniall ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Catholikes</hi> make ſtealing of thinges of ſmale value, and officious lies veniall ſinnes; then M. PER. commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth herein a mortall ſinne, in belying them ſo maliciouſly, as to affirme them to make that no ſinne, which Gods word maketh a ſinne: ſeeing that by his owne confeſſion vve make them and ſuch like, <hi>ſinnes,</hi> though not ſo haynous becauſe there is leſſe malice in them. He goeth on lying, vvhen he affirmeth vs to ſay, that <hi>none is bound to ſalute his enemy:</hi> for we hold all men bound to ſalute their enemies, and to afford them all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duties of ciuillity; and though it be but a counſell to yeeld them the extraordinary offices of friendſhippe, yet vve hold that it is much more Chriſtan-like ſo to doe. As for <hi>raſh judgement ſodainely giuen without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſement,</hi> I ſee not howe it can be more then a veniall ſinne: for the party conſidering better of the matter, changeth his opinion ſtraight way, and ſo doth his neighbour no vvrong. And if it be the part of a wiſe man ſometimes to diſſemble, according vnto that ſaying of the wiſe: <hi>Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis est loco diſsimulare;</hi> then ſurely is it better to diſſemble and fayne holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then wickedneſſe. As for <hi>painting of the face</hi> in a moderate and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt faſhion, to amend the fauour, vvhen it is done without any euill end or purpoſe, and without ſcandall, I ſee not howe one can make any more of it, then a veniall ſinne: but to daube the countenance ſo as ſome leude women doe, to allure men thereby to vnlawfull luſt, is without doubt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry damnable, and for no other is taken of <hi>Catholikes.</hi> Touching <hi>begging,</hi> let him name who holdeth it for vnlawfull to prohibite and forbidde it, if ſufficient meanes be otherwiſe prouided for the mainetaynance of the poore, for I knowe none ſuch. True it is, becauſe the truth it ſelfe hath ſo ſaid: <hi>That we ſhall haue alwayes the poore among vs.</hi>

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, no authour can be truly ſaid to vphold or excuſe <hi>blaſphemy</hi> or <hi>ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> though vvhen they deliuer their opinions in ſchooles concerning that matter, they affirme that raſh cholerike othes (not being vſuall) are no mortall ſinnes, becauſe they breake out in manner againſt a mans vvil; choler for the time troubling and hindering the vſe of reaſon.</p>
               <p>M. PERKINS doth laſtly charge <hi>our writers with manifeſt lying, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our doctrine, in that they pleade all antiquity to be on our ſides: whereas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is as much for them as for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereof he yeeldeth no proofe, and no maruaile; for many of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren are aſhamed to denie this, and doe ingeniouſly confeſſe, that in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:23774:108"/> many points of religion the auncient Fathers are wholy for vs. And in no one point that I can heare off, will he or any of his pew-fellowes be tryed by the judgement and conſent of antiquity: vvhich is a moſt manifeſt proofe, that in their owne conſcience they knowe wel enough, that al an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity is flat againſt them; elſe vvhy ſhould they ſo feare to ſtand vnto their moſt vpright determination, and ſo fleete and flie from it? vvhich point vvell conſidered off, is alone ſufficient to diſſwade any man from their newe doctrine. For it not agreeing with the doctrine of pure anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, muſt needes be falſe and wicked; becauſe that was moſt true, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and good: And the holy Ghoſt doth not nowe teach one to be true, and afterward change. After his <hi>Laſtly</hi> he hath: <hi>Againe, that our manner is to proue our opinions by forged and counterfeit writinges of men: namely by S.</hi> Iames <hi>liturgie, by the Canons of the Apoſtles, by the bookes of</hi> Dioniſius <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagita,</hi> and ſo forth reckoning vp ſome one and twenty peeces, which he calleth counterfeit; but he goeth not about to proue any one of them to be forged. It may therefore ſuffice for anſwere; that when he or any other ſhall vndertake to proue, that we vſe any forged writinges to confirme our doctrine, they ſhall (God willing) be anſwered. In the meane ſeaſon the better to content ſuch weaklings, I haue not paſt once (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) alleaged any ſentence out of theſe bookes, by him ſuſpected for counterfeit. And as touching the marrying of a <hi>Catholike</hi> vvith a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> we diſlike it more then many Miniſters, who will make no bones to marrie them togither; which no <hi>Catholike</hi> Prieſt wil doe. Finally, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with him in leagues of amity as he tearmeth them, and hold that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes, may not combine in league to defend each other in all cauſes, or elſe one ſhould ſtand bound to aide the other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt both honeſty and religion; which were very abſurd: So as where M. PERKINS ſaith well (vvhich he doth ſeldome in this booke of his) I willingly agree vvith him, not ſparing on the other ſide to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that which he ſpeaketh againſt the truth; vvhich all indifferent men will (I hope) take to be honeſt vpright dealing. Here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his booke, vvere it not that after <hi>finis</hi> put to it, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a further Aduertiſement, which may not be left vnanſwered: vvherefore, I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed hereunto both it and the anſwere, before I come to the full period of this worke.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAD once determined to haue wholy omitted this goodly <hi>poſt-ſcript,</hi> becauſe it containeth (in manner) nothing elſe, but an irkeſome repetition of that, which hath beene (I will not ſay twiſe before, but more then twenty times) handled ouer and ouer, in this former ſmall treatiſe: notwithſtanding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering both howe ready many are, when they ſee any thing omitted, to ſay that it could not be anſwered; and alſo for that theſe pointes here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated, are the moſt odious that he could cull out of all the reſt to vrge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs: I finally reſolued to giue them a ſhort anſwere; And further, alſo by prouing their newe religion, to be very oppoſite vnto thoſe old groundes of the true religion, to requite him with the like, that I die not in his debt. Thus he beginneth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Roman religion eſtabliſhed by the Councell of</hi> Trent, <hi>is in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall pointes thereof, against the very groundes of the Catechiſme: the Creede: the tenne Commandements: the Lordes prayer: the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Catholike</hi> religion embraced and defended by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was planted and eſtabliſhed there by the Apoſtles <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> fifteene hundreth yeares before the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and hath beene euer ſithence, by the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> their lawfull ſucceſſors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reteined, and moſt ſincerely obſerued and maintayned: ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles thereof, called into queſtion by the <hi>Heretikes</hi> of this latter age, were in that moſt learned generall Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> declared and defined. And great meruaile it were, if the principall pointes thereof, ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the groundes of the <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> which is in euery point moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially expounded, by the decree and order of the very ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Or is it credible, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (with which all other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23774:110"/> ancient Churches and holy Fathers, did deſire to agree; and which hath beene euer moſt diligent to obſerue all Apoſtolicall traditions) ſhould in the principall points of faith, croſſe and deſtroy the very principles of that religion, that hath beene agreed vpon by all Churches euer ſince the Apoſtles daies, as he ſaith? Is it not much more likely and probable, that the <hi>Protestantes,</hi> who ſlaunder all Churches, euer ſince the time of the Apoſtles, with ſome kind of corruption or other, and who hold no kind of Apoſtolicall tradition to be neceſſary: is it not (I ſay) more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that they ſhould ſhake thoſe groundes of faith, which come by tradition from the Apoſtles, and haue beene euer ſince by all Churches agreed vpon? I ſuppoſe that fewe men of any indifferent judgement, can thinke the contrarie. But let vs deſcend to the particulers, wherein the truth will appeare more plainely. Thus beginneth Maſter PERKINS with the Creede.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First of all it must be conſidered, that ſome of the principall doctrines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are; that the Biſhoppe of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Vicar of Christ, and head of the</hi> Catholike <hi>Church: that there is a fire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: that Images of God and Saintes, are to be placed in the Church, and worſhipped: that prayer is to be made to Saintes departed: that there is a propitiatory ſacrifice daylie offered in the</hi> Maſſe, <hi>for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead. Theſe pointes are of that moment, that without them the</hi> Roman <hi>religion cannot ſtand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And yet marke the Apostles Creede, which hath beene thought to contayne all neceſſary pointes of religion to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, and hath therefore beene called the</hi> key and rule of faith: <hi>This Creede</hi> (I ſay) <hi>hath not any of theſe pointes, nor the expoſitions made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the ancient Fathers; nor any other Creede or confeſsion of faith made by any Councell or Church, for the ſpace of many hundreth yeares. This is a plaine proofe to any indifferent man, that theſe be newe articles of faith, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knowne in the Apostolike Church; and that the Fathers and Councels could not finde any ſuch articles of faith in the bookes of the old and newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Anſwere is made, that all theſe points of doctrine are beleeued vnder the article,</hi> (I beleeue the Catholike Church:) <hi>the meaning whereof they will haue to be this. I beleeue all thinges which the</hi> Catholike <hi>Church hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and teacheth to be beleeued. If this be as they ſay, we must beleeue in the Church: that is, put our confidence in the Church, for the manifeſtation and the certainety of all doctrine neceſſary to ſaluation. And thus the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall truth of God the creatour, ſhall depend vpon the determination of the creature; And the written word of God in this respect is made inſufficient, as though it had not plainely reuealed all points of doctrine pertaining to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the ancient Churches haue beene farre ouer-ſeene, that did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23774:110"/> the former pointes to be beleeued as articles of faith, but left them to theſe later times.</hi> Thus farre Maſter PERKINS: Wherein are hudled vp many thinges confuſedly: I will anſwere briefly and diſtinctlie to euery point.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that <hi>in the Apostles Creede are contained all pointes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion neceſſary to be beleeued,</hi> which is moſt apparantly falſe, as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes</hi> themſelues muſt needes confeſſe; or elſe graunt, that it is not neceſſary to beleeue the King to be Supreame-head of the Church: or that the Church is to be gouerned by Biſhops: or that vve are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſtes juſtice imputed to vs: or that there be but two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: or that the Church ſeruice muſt be ſaid in the vulgar tongue; or that all thinges neceſſary to be beleeued to ſaluation, are contained in the Scriptures. To be ſhort, not one article of their religion (which is contrary to ours) is contained in this Creede of the Apoſtles: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to affirme as de doth, all neceſſarie pointes of religion to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Creede, is to caſt their owne religion flat to the ground; and to teach, that not one point of it is to be beleeued: this Creede may neuertheleſſe be called the <hi>key</hi> and <hi>rule of faith,</hi> becauſe it containeth the principall pointes of the Chriſtian religion, and doth open (as it were) the doore vnto all the reſt, and guide a man certainely vnto the knowledge of them, by teaching vs to beleeue the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.</note> which being <hi>the piller and ground of truth,</hi> directed and <hi>guided by the ſpirit of truth,</hi> will alwaies inſtruct her obedient children, in all truth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Then ſaith Maſter PERKINS: <hi>The eternal truth of God, the creatour ſhal depend on the determination of the creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing leſſe: for Gods truth is moſt ſincere and certaine in it ſelfe, before anie declaration of the Church: but vve poore creatures that are ſubject to miſtaking and errour, ſhould not ſo certaynelie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and knowe that truth of God, vnleſſe he had ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſuch a ſkilfull and faithfull Miſtris and interpreter, to aſſure vs both what is his word, and what is the true meaning of it. Like as pure gold, is not made perfect in it ſelfe by the Gold-ſmithes touch-ſtone; but other men are thereby aſſured, that it is true and pure gold: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the word of God doth not borrowe his truth from the Church; but the true children of God are by the holie Church aſſured, which is the ſame his word. If we did hold (as we doe not) that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vvord contayneth all pointes of doctrine neceſſarie to ſaluation: yet vvere it moſt neceſſarie to relie vpon the <hi>Catholike</hi> Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, both to be aſſured which bookes of Scriptures be Canonicall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23774:111"/> which not; (whereupon <hi>S. Augustine</hi> (a man of farre better judgement then any of theſe daies) ſaid,<note place="margin">Con. Epiſt. Iud. cap. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that he would not beleeue the Gospell, vnleſſe the authority of the Church moued him thereunto:</hi>) as alſo to vnderſtand them tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe the wordes of holy Scripture, without the true meaning and ſence of them, doe but deceiue men and leade them into errour; and to that end haue alwaies beene, and yet are, by <hi>Heretikes</hi> abuſed, to drawe others after them into deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The like may be ſaid of <hi>other ancient Creedes,</hi> and <hi>confeſsions of faith,</hi> which holding the Apoſtles Creede, did adde ſome fewe pointes vnto it: namely, ſuch as were in thoſe daies called into queſtion by <hi>Heretikes</hi> of greater fame, and who were followed of many, not touching in particuler diuers other articles generally beleeued of all true Chriſtians, or elſe by ſome fewe and obſcure men only queſtioned. Wherefore to argue that no other pointes of faith are to be beleeued, but ſuch as are expreſſed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Creedes, is to cut of a great part of our faith.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is moſt vntrue to ſay that thoſe ancient Fathers and Councels <hi>knewe not of theſe articles of faith</hi> by him mentioned: for they haue moſt plainely taught them in their writinges: yea, and expreſly condemned of hereſie, moſt of the contrary poſitions, nowe againe reuiued and holden by the <hi>Protestantes;</hi> as in thoſe ſeuerall queſtions I haue before proued.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>beleeuing in the Church,</hi> which he thruſteth in by the way, we vſe not that phraſe, as the very Creede ſheweth; following therein <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> with others, who hold, that to <hi>beleeue in</hi> a thing, is to make it our creatour, by giuing our whole hart vnto it; in which ſence we beleeue not in Saintes, nor in the Church: albeit ſome other ancient Doctors, take the wordes to <hi>beleeue in,</hi> not ſo preciſely, but ſay that me may <hi>beleeue in</hi> the Church &amp; in Saintes: that is, beleeue certainely that the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church is the only true company of Chriſtians; and that to the lawfull gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof, it appertaineth to declare both which bookes be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and what is the true meaning of all doubtfull places in them: ſo we beleeue the Saintes in heauen to heare our prayers, to be carefull to pray for vs, &amp; to be able to obtaine by intreaty much at Gods handes, in whoſe high fauour they liue. Thus much in anſwere vnto that which M. PER. objecteth in generall, nowe to that he ſaith in particuler.</p>
            <p>He chargeth vs firſt, <hi>with the breach of the third article,</hi> Conceiued by the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ouerturned by the tranſubſtantiation of bread and wine in the</hi> Maſſe, <hi>into the body and bloud of Christ: for here we are taught to confeſſe the true and perpetuall incarnation of Christ, beginning in his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and neuer ending afterward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is a ſtrange expoſition of the Creede. Is Chriſtes incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23774:111"/> perpetuall, and not yet ended? then it is true to ſay, that Chriſt is not yet incarnate; as we may ſay truly, that a man is not borne, vntill his birth be accompliſhed and ended. But to the preſent purpoſe: becauſe Chriſtes incarnation beganne at his conception, cannot bread be turned afterward into his body? how hangeth this together? Belike he meanes <hi>that Christes body was but once conceiued, and that was by the holy Ghoſt in his mothers wombe:</hi> therefore it cannot afterward be made of any other thing. This to be his meaning, he declares in the queſtion of the Sacrament; but it is too too ſimple and childiſh. For we hold him not to be ſo conceiued by bread, as he was by the holy Ghoſt, who was the efficient cauſe of his conception: but that the ſame body that was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued by the holy Ghoſt, is made really preſent in the Sacrament, by tranſubſtantiation of bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, which hath no oppoſition at al with this article, as I haue more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued in the foreſaid queſtion. And whereas he ſaith further, cleane beſides the purpoſe of this article, <hi>that Christes body hath the eſſentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a true body, ſtanding of fleſh and bone:</hi> we grant the ſame; but when he addeth <hi>that local circumſcription cannot be ſeuered from a body,</hi> he is deceiued: for the greateſt body of all others, (which is the higheſt heauen) is not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed by any place; becauſe there is no other body without it, whoſe extreamities might compaſſe in, and circumſcribe that body of the higheſt heauen. And when he ſaith, <hi>that to be circumſcribed in place, is an eſſentiall property of euery quantity; and that quantity is the common eſſence of euery body:</hi> he makes himſelfe but a common mocking-ſtocke vnto euery ſimple Logitian, who knoweth that no accident (ſuch as euery <hi>quantity</hi> is) can be of the eſſence and nature of a <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> ſuch as Chriſtes body is. Neither would any man ſay, (that cared what he ſaid) that to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in a place is eſſentiall to euery quantity, when all <hi>numbers</hi> that be quantities, haue no relation vnto any place: neither is it of the eſſence of any quantity to be actually circumſcribed by a place; but it is a property flowing out of the eſſence of one only kinde of quantity, <hi>to be apt, and fit to be circumſcribed</hi> and compaſſed about with a place. And naturally all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (except the higheſt heauen) haue one place, out of which they paſſe (as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ſaid) when they come into another: but by the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power of God, any body may be ſeparated from his place, or be in as many places at once, as it ſhal pleaſe God to ſeate it; becauſe to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with a place actually, is a meere accident vnto a ſubſtantiall body, and without the nature of quantity; and God may not without blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie be diſabled to ſeperate a ſubſtance from an accident. By this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed alſo his ſecond inſtance: <hi>Christ is aſcended into heauen, and ſitteth at the right hand of God the Father, therefore his body is not really and locally in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:23774:112"/> This followeth not, becauſe it is in both places at once, as <hi>S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi> in expreſſe tearmes teacheth.<note place="margin">Chriſ. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd.</note> 
               <hi>O miracle! O goodneſſe of God! he that ſitteth aboue with his Father, at the very ſame inſtant is touched with the handes of all men, and giueth himſelfe to them that will receiue and embrace him!</hi> See more of this in the queſtion of the bleſſed Sacrament, where M. PERKINS citeth the very ſame authorities, which he here repeteth: ſee my anſwere to them there.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he reaſoneth thus: <hi>In that we beleeue the</hi> Catholike <hi>Church, it followeth that it is inuiſible, becauſe thinges ſeene, are not beleeued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwere: that the perſons in the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church are and euer were viſible, euen to <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> who perſecuted them; but the inward indowmentes of thoſe perſons: that is, their faith, hope, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; their aſſiſtance by Gods ſpirit, and ſuch like Chriſtian qualities, are inuiſible and to be beleeued. And euen as a man is truly ſaid to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though he conſiſt aſwell of an inuiſible ſoule, as of a viſible body: ſo the Church is viſible, for the viſible perſons, viſible teaching and adminiſtring of Sacraments in it; albeit the inward qualities of it be not viſible.</p>
            <p>His laſt objection againſt vs out of the Creede, is: <hi>That the articles of remiſsion of ſinnes; reſurrection of the body; and life euerlaſting, containe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of ſpeciall faith. For the meaning of them is thus much: I beleeue the remiſsion of mine owne ſinnes, and the reſurrection of mine owne body to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi> That is not the meaning, vnleſſe you adde ſome conditions: to wit, <hi>I beleeue the remiſsion of my ſinnes,</hi> if I haue duly vſed the meanes ordained by our Sauiour for the remiſſion of them; which is after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the Sacrament of Penance. Item, <hi>I beleeue I ſhal haue life euerlaſting,</hi> if I keepe (as Chriſt willed the yong-man to keepe) Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or (at the leaſt) if I doe die with true repentance. Nowe whether I haue done or ſhall doe theſe thinges required of me, I am not ſo well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as that I can beleeue it: for I may be deceiued therein; but I haue or may haue a very good hope, by the grace of God to performe them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any more to be gathered out of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> as ſome of the wordes by himſelfe here alleaged doe conuince.

               <hi>which God (that cannot lie) hath promiſed to his children, no man can be ſecure</hi> (and out of danger) <hi>before his life be ended, which is a tentation vpon earth.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that a man once truly justified may afterward fall: We muſt beleeue</hi> (ſaith this holie Father) <hi>that certaine of the children of perdition doe liue in faith, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by charity, and ſo doe for a time liue faithfully and juſtly</hi> (they were then truly juſtified) <hi>and yet afterward doe fall,</hi> and that finally; becauſe he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth then the children of perdition. Thus much in anſwere vnto that, which Maſter PERKINS objecteth againſt our religion out of the Creede, which (as you haue ſeene) conſiſteth wholy vpon his owne forced expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and vaine illations.</p>
            <p>Hence he proceedeth to the tenne Commandements. But before I followe him thither, I may not omitte here to declare howe the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctors doe fouly mangle, and in manner ouer-turne the greateſt part of the Creede. Obſerue firſt, that according to their common doctrine, it is not neceſſary to beleeue this Creede at all, becauſe it is no part of the written word: ſecondly, that <hi>Caluin</hi> doubteth whether it were made by the Apoſtles or no;<note place="margin">Cal. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Inſtit. cap. <hi>16.</hi> ſeſſ. <hi>18</hi>
               </note> being then no part of the written word, not made by the Apoſtles, it muſt by their doctrine be wholy rejected. Nowe to the particulers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the firſt article, <hi>I beleeue in God the Father almighty, maker of heauen and earth,</hi> they doe erre many waies. Firſt, they doe deſtroy the moſt ſimple vnitie of the God-head,<note place="margin">Confeſſ. fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei gener.</note> by teaching <hi>the diuine eſſence to be really diſtinguiſhed into three perſons.</hi> If the diuine nature be really diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into three, there muſt needes be three diuine eſſences or natures: <hi>ergo,</hi> three Gods. <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">In actis Serueti. pag. <hi>872.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, howe is God almightie, if he cannot doe all thinges that haue no manifeſt repugnance in them? But he cannot after the opinion

For the chiefeſt act of Chriſtes mediation, conſiſteth in his death: if then the God-head did not ſuffer that death, it had no part in the principal point of Chriſts mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Hither alſo appertaine all theſe their blaſphemies, to wit: <hi>that Christ was ſo frighted with the apprehenſion of death, that he forgotte himſelfe to be our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour; yea refuſed</hi> (as much as in him lay) <hi>to be our redeemer:</hi> Item, <hi>that he thought himſelfe forſaken of God, and finally despaired.

               <hi>Beza</hi> followed of <hi>Corliel</hi> our Country-man, <hi>thinkes this to haue crept into the Creede by negligence;</hi> and ſo the <hi>French Hugonots,</hi> and <hi>Flemiſh Gues</hi> haue caſt it cleane out of their Creede: but they are miſliked of many others, who had rather admit the wordes, becauſe they be found in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Creede, and alſo in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Creede expounded by <hi>Ruffinus:</hi> but they doe moſt peruerſly expound them. <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaith, that Chriſtes ſuffering of the paines of hell on the Croſſe, is ſignified by theſe wordes: but he pleaſeth not ſome others of them; becauſe Chriſtes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and death alſo, goeth before his deſcending into hel, and the wordes muſt be taken orderly as they lie. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> diuers of them will haue it to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23774:113"/> ſignifie, the laying of Chriſtes body in the graue; but that is ſignified plainely by the word, <hi>buried.</hi> Wherefore ſome others of them expound it to ſignifie, the lying of his body in the graue three daies, which M.

For what likeneſſe is there betweene ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the graue, and deſcending into hell?

               </note> and calleth it <hi>an jdle fancy.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Luther, Smideline,</hi> and others cited by <hi>Beza, art.</hi> 2. doe ſay, that Chriſtes ſoule after his death went to hell, where the Diuels are, there to be puniſhed for our ſinnes, thereby to purchaſe vs a fuller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; which is ſo blaſphemous that it needes not any refutation. As ridiculous is another, receiued of moſt <hi>Proteſtantes;</hi> that Chriſtes ſoule went into Paradiſe, which well vnderſtood is true. For his ſoule in hell, had the joyes of Paradiſe; but to make that an expoſition of Chriſtes deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into hell, is to expound a thing by the flat contrary of it. Al theſe and ſome other expoſitions alſo, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> haue deuiſed, to lead their followers from the ancient, and only true interpretation of it: to wit, that Chriſt in ſoule deſcended vnto thoſe lower partes of the earth, where all the ſoules departed from the beginning of the world, were detained by the juſt judgement of God, till Chriſt had paide their ranſome; and were not admitted into the kingdome of heauen, before Chriſt had opened them the way thither.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Concerning <hi>Christes reſurrection,</hi> they doe alſo erre. For whereas a reſurrection is the riſing vp of the very ſame body that died, with all his naturall partes: they denie Chriſt to haue taken againe the <hi>ſame bloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal. in <hi>27.</hi> Math. Perkins pag. <hi>194.</hi> In cap. <hi>24.</hi> Lucae.</note> which he ſhed in his paſſion; and yet is the bloud one notable part of the body. <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo affirmeth it to <hi>be an old wifes dreame,</hi> to thinke that in Chriſtes handes and feete there remaine the print of nailes, and the wound in his ſide, notwithſtanding that Chriſt ſhewed them to his Diſciples, and offered them to be touched of <hi>S. Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. About <hi>Chriſtes aſſenſion into heauen,</hi> they doe ſomewhat diſſent from the truth. For ſome of them ſay, that Chriſts body did not pearce through the heauens by vertue of a glorious body (leaſt they ſhould thereby be compelled to graunt, that two naturall bodies may be together in one place, and therefore as well one true body in two places at once) but that broad gappes were made in the lower heauens, to make him way to the higheſt, which is very ridiculous, and more againſt true Philoſophy: they ſay alſo,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1, 18.</note> that he was not the firſt man that entered into the poſſeſſion of heauen, which is flat againſt the Scriptures, that call Chriſt the <hi>first fruites and firſt begotten</hi> of the dead. Thirdly, they locke Chriſt ſo cloſely vp in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23774:114"/> heauen,<note place="margin">Beza in c. <hi>2.</hi> actorum</note> that they hold it impoſſible for him to remoue thence at any time before the laſt judgement (for feare they ſhould otherwiſe be inforced to confeſſe, that his body may be in two places at once) which is to make him not Lord of the place, but ſome poore priſoner therein. And as for Chriſts <hi>ſitting on the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of his Father,</hi> they are not yet agreed what it ſignifieth. <hi>See</hi> Conrad.<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> ar. <hi>25</hi> de concor.

               </note> 
               <hi>Caluin</hi> plainely ſaith, that <hi>after the later judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he ſhal ſit there no longer. That God ſhal then render to euery man according to his workes</hi> (as holy Scripture very often doth teſtifie) al the packe of them doth vtterly denie.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>I beleeue in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Firſt <hi>Caluin</hi> and his followers (who hold <hi>the holy Ghoſt to haue the God-head of himſelfe, and not to haue receiued it from the Father and the Sonne</hi>) muſt conſequently denie the holy Ghoſt to proceede from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the Preface.</note> as hath beene elſe where proued. Secondly, they make him much inferiour vnto the other perſons: for they teach in their <hi>French</hi> Catechiſmes, <hi>that the Father alone is to be adored in the name of the Sonne.</hi>

               <hi>Father holdeth the firſt ranke of honour and gouernement,</hi> and <hi>the Sonne the ſecond;</hi> where the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> is either quite excluded from part with the Father and the Sonne, or at moſt, muſt be content with the third degree of honour.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>I beleeue the holy</hi> Catholike <hi>Church, the communion of Saints.</hi> Firſt, where as there is but <hi>one Catholike</hi> Church,<note place="margin">one</note> as the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> expreſly defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, following ſundry textes of the word of God; they commonly teach that there be two Churches: one <hi>inuiſible</hi> of the elect; another <hi>viſible</hi> of both good and bad. Secondly, they imagine it to be <hi>holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">holy</note> by the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtes holineſſe to the elected Bretheren, and not by the infuſion of the holy Ghoſt into the hartes of all the faithfull. Thirdly, they cannot abide the name <hi>Catholike</hi> in the true ſence of it:<note place="margin">Catholike</note> that is, they wil not beleeue the true Church, to haue beene alwaies viſibly extant ſince the Apoſtles time, and to haue bin generally ſpread into all Countries; otherwiſe they muſt needes forſake their owne Church, which began with <hi>Friar Luther,</hi> and is not receiued generally in the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world. Finally, they beleeue no Church, no not their owne in all points of faith: but hold that the true Church may erre in ſome principall points of faith. Howe then can any man ſafely relie his ſaluation, vpon the credite of ſuch an vncertaine ground &amp; erring guide? may they not then as well ſay that they doe not beleeue the <hi>one Catholike</hi> Church: becauſe they doe as well not beleeue it, as beleeue it? And as <hi>for the communion of Saints,</hi> their learned maſters doe commonly caſſier it out of the Creede, and that not without cauſe. For by the <hi>Saints</hi> vnderſtanding (as the Apoſtles did) al good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23774:114"/> whither aliue or departed this world, they that deny praier <hi>to Saints,</hi> and for the <hi>ſoules in Purgatory,</hi> haue reaſon to reject the common ſociety &amp; entercourſe that is betweene the Saints, and the mutuall honour and help, which ſuch good Chriſtian ſoules doe yeeld and afford one to another.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>The forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> It is not eaſily to find what is their ſetled opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, touching the forgiuenes of originall ſinne in Infants. Some attribute it to Baptiſme; but that cannot ſtand with their common doctrine, <hi>that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments haue no vertue in them to remit ſinnes, or to giue grace.</hi> Others ſay, that God without any meanes doth then, when they be baptiſed, of himſelfe immediately juſtifie them; but that cannot ſtand in their owne doctrine, becauſe Infants want the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of faith to lay hold on that juſtice then offered by God, and therefore cannot being ſo yonge, take it vnto them. Others will haue Infants ſanctified in their mothers wombe, by vertue of a couenant, which they ſuppoſe God to haue made with old father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and all his faithfull ſeruants, that <hi>(forſooth)</hi> their ſeede ſhall be holy; But this is moſt phantaſtical, and contrary to the Scriptures and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: for <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the ſonne of promiſe, and yet <hi>Eſau</hi> his ſonne was a reprobate; <hi>Dauides</hi> father was a Godly <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and yet <hi>Dauid</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.</note> that he himſelfe <hi>was conceiued in iniquities;</hi> and we may ſee whole Countries nowe turned <hi>Turkes,</hi> whoſe anceſtors were good Chriſtians: therefore not all the ſoules of the faithfull, are ſanctified in their mothers wombes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how euil ſoeuer they agree about the remiſſion of ſinne; yet there is a perfect conſent among them, that ſuch relikes of originall ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in euery man baptiſed and ſanctified, that it infecteth all and euery worke he doth, with deadly ſinne: yea that which remaineth is <hi>properly ſinne in it ſelfe,</hi> though it be not imputed to the party; ſo that ſinne is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in them, though their ſinnes be neuer ſo well forgiuen. And as for the <hi>Sacrament of Penance,</hi> by which we hold al ſinnes committed after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to be forgiuen; they doe renounce the benefit of it, and are at vtter defiance with it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>The reſurrection of the bodies.</hi> Whether <hi>Farel</hi> the firſt Apoſtle of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuian Gospel</hi> doubted thereof or no, let his ſucceſſor <hi>Caluin</hi> tell you, who anſwereth <hi>Farels</hi> letter thus.<note place="margin">Epiſto. ad Farellum.</note>

            <p>I omit here many other particularities, that I be not ouer tedious: For theſe their bickeringes againſt the very principles of our Chriſtian faith, (not leauing any one article of our Creede vnſkirmiſhed with all) will ſerue any indifferent man for a warning, to beware of their prophane do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that leadeth the high way to Infidelity.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> None of the counſels of perfection are enjoyned in the tenne Commandements, though for ſome affinity, they may be reduced to ſome of them. For example: It is commanded that <hi>I ſhall not ſteale,</hi> that is: to take any of my neighbours goodes againſt his will; but to giue away all my owne to the poore, is beyond the compaſſe of the lawe: ſo likewiſe it is commanded not to commit adultery; but we are not commanded to vowe perpetuall chaſtity and obedience. Such offices only that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to the performance of any commandement, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended with in the ſame, but no others; though ſome men take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the commandement, to treate of the counſels of perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> (ſaith M. PER.) <hi>the Commandement, thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath two ſeuerall partes: the firſt forbiddeth the making of Images: the ſecond the adoration of them.</hi> He concludeth out of Deutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, <hi>that the Images of the true</hi> Iehoua <hi>are forbidden in the Commandement, and conſequently the adoration of ſuch Images.</hi> Hence he will haue it to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, <hi>that to worſhip God in or at Images with religious worſhip, is abominable Idolatrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt if the <hi>Images of God only</hi> be there prohibited, and then <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip done to them</hi> according to his owne expoſition, then it followeth moſt clearely, that there is no prohibition for either making or worſhipping the Images of any Saints; and therefore with a very euill conſcience doth he wreſt the commandement againſt them. Secondly I ſay, though God had forbidden vs to worſhippe Images, yet doth it not followe thereof, that we muſt not worſhip God <hi>in, or at Images.</hi> For as God is euery where; ſo may he be worſhipped in all places, and as well at or before an Image; as in the Church, and before the communion table. Thirdly, we make no Images to expreſſe the nature of God, which is a ſpirit, and cannot be repreſented by lines and colours, but only alowe of ſome ſuch pictures, as ſet out ſome apparitions of God, recorded in the <hi>Bible;</hi> not doubting but that ſuch workes of God, may aſwell be expreſſed in colours to our eies, as they are by wordes to our eares and vnderſtanding. Laſtly, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religious worſhip to be done to Saintes or pictures, the <hi>Heretikes</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling conſiſteth principally in the diuers taking of the word <hi>religious.</hi> For it is <hi>ambiguous,</hi> &amp; principally ſignifieth the worſhip only due to God;<note place="margin">Analogon.</note> in which ſence to giue it to any creature were Idolatry: but it is alſo with the beſt authors taken ſome other time, to ſignifie a worſhip due to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for ſome ſupernaturall vertue or quality in them; and in this ſence to tearme it deteſtable Idolatry, is either deteſtable malice, or damnable ignorance. And whereas (he ſaith) that common reaſon teacheth, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23774:116"/> they who adore God in Images, doe bind God and his hearing of vs, to certaine thinges and places: I ſay the contrary, that God may be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in all places; but we rather chooſe to worſhip him in Churches and before Images then in other places, becauſe the ſight of ſuch holy thinges, doe breed more reuerence and deuotion in vs, &amp; better keepe our mindes from wandering vpon vaine matters. If we taught that God could be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped no where elſe, or by no other meanes, then he had not lied ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But let vs heare the end of his diſcourſe: thus he argueth. <hi>They that worſhip, they knowe not what, worſhip an Idol.</hi> This expoſition is falſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they worſhip it with diuine honour. But goe on: <hi>the</hi> Papiſts <hi>worſhip they knowe not what. I proue it thus: to the conſecration of the Hoſt, there it required the intention of the</hi> Prieſt: <hi>but they cannot haue any certainety of the</hi> Prieſtes <hi>intention, wherefore they are not certaine whether it be bread, or the body of Christ.</hi> ergo, <hi>worſhipping of it, they worſhip they knowe not what.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, here is leaping from the Commandements to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is out of order: ſecondly, I returne his argument vpon him ſelfe. To their ſeruice and in the adminiſtration of the <hi>Lordes ſupper,</hi> the <hi>Miniſters</hi> intention is required: for if he intend to ſerue the Diuell, and by giuing them the communion to bind them the faſter to him; then doe they (in ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to his praiers, &amp; receiuing the communion at his handes) joyne with him in the Diuels ſeruice. Nowe they haue no more certainety of their <hi>Miniſters</hi> meaning, then we haue of our <hi>Prieſts</hi> intention: yea much leſſe of many of them, who are mad-merry fellowes, and care not greatly whereabout they goe, nor what they intend: muſt they therefore flie from their diuine ſeruice and holy communion, becauſe they be not certaine of their <hi>Miniſters</hi> intention therein? Surely they ſhould, if his reaſon were ought worth. But in ſuch caſes we muſt perſwade our ſelues that Gods <hi>Ministers</hi> doe their dutie, vnleſſe we ſee great cauſe to the contrary; and thereupon are we bold to doe our dutie to the bleſſed Sacrament: If he ſhould faile in his, yet our intention being pure to adore Chriſtes holy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy only, and nothing elſe there, we ſhould formally be the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Chriſt, though materially we were miſtaken in that Hoſt; which to tearme Idolatry, is to ſtile our Sauiour IESVS Chriſt an Idoll, and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore blaſphemy in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p>His third objection is out of the fourth Commandement, <hi>which</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>giueth a liberty to worke ſix daies in the ordinary affaires of our calling, which liberty</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cannot be repealed by any creature: the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>therefore erreth, in that it preſcribeth other ſet and ordinary feſtiuall daies, to be obſerued as ſtraightly, and with as much ſolemnity as the</hi> Sabbaoth <hi>of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doth not the Church of <hi>England</hi> alſo preſcribe the Natiuity of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23774:116"/> our Sauiour, and of <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> the feaſtes of the Apoſtles, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be kept holy, and command that no man worke in the affaires of their calling thoſe daies? doth their owne Church alſo erre therein? How ſay you then to the Church of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which kept the feaſtes of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Whitſontide,</hi> and of the <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> as ſtraightly and with as much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, as they kept the Lordes <hi>Sabbaoth:</hi> was it alſo miſ-led to the breach of Gods Commandements? or muſt we not rather thereby learne, that ſix daies in the weeke, were at the firſt left vs free to labour in; but yet ſo, that by the decree and commandement of our ſpirituall Gouernours, any of them might (vpon juſt occaſion) be made feſtiuall, and thereupon euery good Chriſtian bound to keepe them, by their obedience vnto their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours? to thinke the contrary is a high point of <hi>Puritaniſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly (ſaith M. PER.) <hi>the fiſt Commandement enjoyneth children to obey father and mother in all thinges, ſpecially in matters of moment; as in their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and choice of their calling, and that euen to death: and yet the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>againſt the intent of this Commandement, alloweth that clandeſtine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and the vowe of religion ſhall be in force, though they be without and againſt the conſent of wiſe and carefull parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very falſe to ſay that children muſt obey their parents <hi>in all thinges:</hi> for if parents command them any thing either againſt Gods lawe or the Princes, they muſt not obey them therein. And touching clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine and priuie Marriages, they are of force aſwell in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yea more too. For by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alwaies they haue beene forbidden very ſeuerely; and ſince the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> are made void and of no force, where the Councell can be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. Concerning entring into religion, childrens vowes (during their minority) may be annullated and made of no force by their parents: mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when they come to riper daies, if their father ſtand not in neceſſity of their help, they may forſake him to followe Chriſt in a more perfect kind of life: as <hi>S. Iames</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Iohn</hi> forſoke their father <hi>Zebedee,</hi> &amp; followed Chriſt.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>The laſt Commandement</hi> (ſaith M. PER.) <hi>forbiddeth the firſt motions to ſinne, that are before conſent.</hi> He proueth it thus: <hi>Luſting with conſent is forbidden in the former Commandements: thou ſhalt not commit adultery, and thou ſhalt not ſteale: therefore if the laſt forbid no more, it is confounded with the former.</hi> Againe, <hi>the Philoſophers knew that luſt with conſent was euil, euen by the light of nature; but</hi> Paul <hi>a learned</hi> Phariſee, <hi>knewe not luſt to be ſinne, that is forbid in the Commandement. Luſt therefore that is forbidden here, is without conſent.</hi>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>Wicked then is the doctrine of</hi> Rome, <hi>that requireth our conſent to euery mortall ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their doctrine is moſt reaſonable and godly: For the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſinne, are rather the actions of the euill ſpirit, tempting vs to euill;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23774:117"/> then of a man, in whoſe minde they are before he is aware of them; and who aſſoone as he beginneth to marke them, diſliketh them and chaſeth them thence: and howe can he carry a right opinion of the mild goodnes of God, that thinketh him ſo haſtie with his fraile creature man, as to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him eternally for ſuch a thought, as is thruſt into his minde at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and may come vpon him in his ſleepe, went he neuer ſo well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bed? Se more of this in the queſtion of originall ſinne. To his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the contrary I anſwere to the firſt, that luſt with conſent is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbid in the former commandements, but the act of adultery and ſtealing: yet, it might well haue beene reduced vnto them, as it is in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandements. Neuertheleſſe, becauſe our frailty is more prone to the wicked luſt of concupiſcence, and deſire of our neighbours goodes; it pleaſed God for the better bridling of them, to giue vs particuler pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes againſt them; ſpecially conſidering, that it was alſo very hard, by the dimme light of our darkened reaſon, to diſcerne them to be ſuch capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinnes. And whereas he ſaith, that the Philoſophers knewe the inward conſent of our mind, without any exteriour actes to be mortall ſinne: I take him to ſpeake at randome, and more then he can proue. Sure it is, that many learned <hi>Iewes,</hi> who ſhould knowe more then Philoſophers, knewe not ſo much:<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>5.28.</hi> &amp; <hi>29.</hi> Rom. ca. <hi>7.</hi> verſ. <hi>7.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly</hi> (ſaith M. PER.) <hi>the wordes of the ſecond Commandement (and ſhewe mercy vnto thouſandes on them that loue me, and keepe my Commandements) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth all humane merits.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Either ſimple was this mans judgement ſometimes, or elſe moſt peruerſly bent to deceiue the ſimple. For God ſpeaketh there, neither of the reward that is rendred in heauen for good workes; neither of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at all, that is rendred vnto the perſon himſelfe that keepeth Gods commandements: but of a ſuperaboundant fauour, that God of his bounty will ſhewe vnto thouſandes of others, for one mans ſake that loueth him and keepeth his commandements: therefore very peuiſhly doth he drawe hence any thing againſt merits.</p>
            <p>And to beginne here where M. PER. leaueth, to ſhewe howe their newe doctrine and inuentious, doth croſſe and make void the commandements
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23774:117"/> of God. Firſt in that, <hi>that he promiſeth mercy and fauour vnto thouſandes for ones ſake, that keepeth his Commandements,</hi> we gather: that God in regard of his Saints (who ſo holily obſerued his Commandements) doth graunt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs many fauours and graces: alſo, <hi>that the ſatisfaction of one may ſerue for another;</hi> for elſe God would not puniſh children vnto the third and fourth generation, for the offence of their great grand-father, vnleſſe their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſerued to ſatisfie for their anceſtors offence: hence alſo we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>ſome men doe keepe Gods Commandements,</hi> otherwiſe God did in vaine promiſe to fauour thouſandes for their ſakes that kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, if he knewe well that there ſhould be none ſuch. Therefore moſt vngodly is that poſition of the <hi>Protestantes, that it is impoſsible to keepe the Commandements:</hi> and which alone ouerthroweth all the tenne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. For as all men ſkilfull in the true nature of lawes doe hold: <hi>there can be no just lawe, that is impoſsible to be kept, by the greater part of them to whome the lawe is giuen;</hi> becauſe lawes are both to direct our actions, and doe alſo bind euery man to obſerue them. Nowe what reaſonable lawe-maker will beate his braine to direct a man to doe that, which he knoweth before hand, not to lie in the mans power to doe? and as tyrannical ſhould he be eſteemed, that would bind a man vnder a great penalty, to doe that which he knewe to be impoſſible for him to doe.

               <hi>Who doth not crie out that it is folly to giue him Commandements, in whoſe power it is not to performe them? and who doth not ſay that it is vnjust, to condemne him for not doing just thinges, when he could not doe them?</hi> The <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> therefore affirming the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements not to be poſſible to be performed, doe make them no lawes at all; and ſo they at one blow, doe beate downe al the tenne Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But let vs come to the particulers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt Commandement,</hi> as it forbiddeth vs to worſhip falſe Gods: ſo doth it alſo include a commandement to worſhippe a right the only true God, which is done principally by <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by their peruerting of many articles of our beliefe (as hath bin ſhewed) haue loſt the true <hi>faith,</hi> and by their newe certainety of <hi>faith,</hi> leaue no place for <hi>hope:</hi> for they are paſt hope of ſaluation, that make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo aſſured of it as they doe.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</note> And as for <hi>charity</hi> which S.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23774:119"/> forme of prayer: nowe in this we are taught to direct our prayers to God alone, Our father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that only in the name and mediation of Chriſt; for God is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only by Christ: therefore to vſe any mediation of Saints is needeleſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We allowe our Lordes praier to be a moſt perfect forme of praier: yet hold that many other ſort of praiers may be made vnto God very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, as ſundry other praiers vſed by Chriſt &amp; ſet downe in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doe teach vs: and therefore to argue that becauſe one praier of Chriſts making is directed to God, that no other may be made to any Saint, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry childiſh. We gather praier to Saints out of <hi>S. Paules</hi> requeſting the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and others to pray for him: and out of the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the woman of <hi>Cananea</hi> to Chriſt for her daughter: and the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſpeaking to Chriſt for her; with ſuch like both out of the old and newe Teſtament. For if it had beene either needleſſe or booteleſſe, to haue praied vnto God any otherwiſe, then in the name and by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt; then <hi>S. Paul</hi> would not haue requeſted the helpe of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall mens praiers to God for him: and if poore ſinners praiers may helpe vs, much more may the interceſſion of the glorious Saints doe, who are in farre greater fauour with God: See the queſtion of interceſſion of Saints. Againe, if that only forme of praier were to be vſed, neither were it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pray to Chriſt himſelfe; neither could it be proued thereby, that we ſhould pray in Chriſtes name. For there is no expreſſe mention of Chriſtes name; neither any petition for Chriſtes ſake. For God may be truly called <hi>our father,</hi> in that he immediately createth and giueth vs our ſoules, which is more then our bodies, that we receiue from our carnall fathers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he hoppeth to the fourth petition. <hi>Giue vs our daylie bread: in which wordes we acknowledge</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that euery morſel of bread is the meere gift of God: what madneſſe then is it for vs to thinke that we ſhould merit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, that cannot merit ſo much as bread?</hi> It is falſe that we cannot merit our bread:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</note> For Chriſt teacheth, <hi>that he who goeth to preach the Gospell, is worthy of, that is:</hi> meriteth and deſerueth <hi>his meate;</hi> which <hi>S. Paul</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, ſaying: that <hi>our Lord ordained, that thoſe who preach the Goſpell ſhould liue of the Gospell.</hi> And doe not day labourers deſerue their bread, before they eate it? and others that buy their bread, doe I hope deſerue it. What ignorance then is it, in the very principles of our faith, to auouch that we cannot merit bread? which notwithſtanding we pray God to giue vs; becauſe, neither could we deſerue and yerne it, without his helpe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; neither would it doe vs any good without his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the next petition: <hi>Forgiue vs our debtes; fower opinions of the</hi> Roman <hi>religion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are directly ouerthrowne.</hi> What fower at one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23774:119"/> blowe! what a <hi>Hercules</hi> haue we here? let vs heare which. <hi>The firſt is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſatisfaction: for the child of God is taught here to pray for the pardon of his ſinnes; nowe to pray for pardon and to make ſatisfaction be contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a ſillie ouerthrowe: for it is ſo farre of, that praier and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction are contraries, that praier it ſelfe is one of the three workes of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: <hi>Faſting, Praying,</hi> and <hi>giuing</hi> of <hi>Almeſſe</hi> are not contrary, but the very workes of ſatisfaction.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Simbolo. cap. <hi>6.</hi> in Enchir. cap. <hi>69.</hi>
               </note> And <hi>our Lordes praier</hi> is eſteemed by <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> (who is aſſoone to be beleeued as M. PERKINS) ſufficient of it ſelfe, to ſatisfie for the light daylie offences that juſt men fall into: beſides Chriſt himſelfe praied for pardon of theſe mortall ſinnes, for which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Gods juſtice was fully ſatisfied by Chriſt his ſufferings; wherefore ſatisfaction and to ſue for pardon, are not ſo contrary, but they may well ſtand together.</p>
            <p>Nowe to the ſecond downefall: <hi>merits are here alſo ouerthrowne. For we acknowledge our ſelues debters, and we daylie increaſe our debts: nowe it is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thinke that they, who daylie increaſe their debts, can deſerue or purchaſe any good of the creditors, in a word, this muſt be thought vpon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And good reaſon too. Firſt then I anſwere, that venial ſinnes and ſmal debts that juſt men daylie incurre, doe not hinder the daylie merit of their other good workes. As a ſeruant hired by the day, by committing ſome ſmall fault, doth not thereby looſe his daies wages: againe, though he ſhould commit ſuch a fault, that might make him vnworthy of his daies hire; yet, if his Maſter did forgiue him that fault, his wages were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding due to him: and ſo the aſking pardon for our ſinnes doth not ouerthrowe, but rather eſtabliſh and fortifie our merits.</p>
            <p>The third opinion imagined to be confuted by this petition, is: <hi>that temporall puniſhment may be retained after the crime it ſelfe, and the eternall is remitted: but this cannot ſtand</hi> (ſaith he.) <hi>For we owe to God obedience, and for the defect of this paiment, we owe to God the forfeiture of puniſhment. Sinne then is called our debt, in reſpect of the puniſhment: And therefore when we pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſinnes, we require not only the fault to be pardoned, but the whole puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when debt is pardoned, it is abſurd to thinke that the leaſt paiment ſhould remaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is a moſt abſurd collection: For when we in our <hi>Lordes praier</hi> craue pardon of our debts, we confeſſe that we are in his debt, and that there is paiment of puniſhment yet due vnto vs, the remiſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we then require: nowe this praier is made by the beſt men after their conuerſion (as he confeſſeth) who ſtanding in Gods fauour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free from eternall puniſhment, doe notwithſtanding craue pardon and releaſe of ſome puniſhment, by M. PERKINS owne interpretation:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23774:120"/> Whereupon it followeth moſt euidently out of this petition, that after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall puniſhment is forgiuen vnto the juſt, there is ſome other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remaining, of which they craue pardon; and conſequently this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ours is (by this very petition and M. PER. owne expoſition of it) much ſtrengthned and confirmed, and nothing at all weakened.</p>
            <p>The fourth point of our doctrine hence impugned by M. PER. is <hi>that a man in this life may fulfill the lawe. Whereas in this place euery ſeruant of God is taught to aſke daylie pardon for the breach of the lawe: anſwere is made, that our daylie ſinnes are veniall, and not againſt the lawe, though beſides the lawe: but this which they ſay, is againſt this petition: for a debt that commeth by forfeiture, is against the band or obligation. Nowe euery ſinne is a debt cauſing the forfeiture of puniſhment, and therefore is not beſide, but against the lawe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I graunt that euery ſinne is a debt, cauſing the forfeiture of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but this puniſhment may be ſmall &amp; ſhort, and ſo the ſinne veniall, &amp; the debt not againſt the lawe directly, yet againſt the band of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duty: as the miſpending of time, vſing of ſome jdle wordes, and the committing of ſuch like light faults, which I am bound in reaſon to auoid; but not by any preſcript lawe directly. And thus in fine we ſee, how fouly M. PER. was miſtaken, that thought to ouerthrow fower points of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine at a clap, when not ſo much as one is thereby any whit at all ſtirred.</p>
            <p>He ſaith further, <hi>In this clauſe</hi> (as we forgiue our debters) <hi>it is taken for graunted, that we may certainely knowe that we repent and beleeue, and are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by God; which all</hi> Roman Catholikes <hi>denie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing leſſe, becauſe much more is required to the one, then to the other. For it is farre eaſier to diſcerne, whether I doe yet beare any euil will to my neighbour, then to knowe aſſuredly, that I doe hartily repent me of al my ſinnes, and that for the loue of God; and further that I haue a firme purpoſe not to commit hereafter, any kind of mortall ſinne: theſe thinges (as euery one may plainely ſee) are farre more difficult, then the other of forgiuing them that treſpaſſe againſt vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the laſt wordes:</hi> and lead vs not into temptation, <hi>we pray not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that God ſhould free vs from temptation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>for it is otherwhiles good to be tempted: but that we be not left vnto the malice of Satan, and held captiue of the temptation: for here to be led into temptation, and to be deliuered, are oppoſed. Nowe hence I gather, that he who is the child of God truly juſtified and ſanctified, ſhall neuer fall wholy and finally from the grace of God; and I conclude on this manner.</hi> That which we aſke according to the will of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.</note> ſhall be graunted: <hi>but this the child of God aſketh, that he might neuer be wholy forſaken of his father, and led captiue into temptation: this therefore ſhall be graunted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this argument were ſound, neuer ſhould any Chriſtian that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23774:120"/> ſaith our Lordes praier, fall finally and be damned; becauſe they all make this petition, and that according to the will of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>who would haue all men ſaued.</hi> Many thinges then beſides ſaying our <hi>Lordes praier,</hi> are required to ſaluation, for want of which many that haue often ſaid that praier fall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Againe, he miſtaketh the true ſence of that petition: for therein we doe not aſke that we continue not in ſinne, which we aſked in the former petition <hi>(forgiue vs our trespaſſes)</hi> but we pray that we be not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Deuill, by yeelding our conſent to the temptation, and ſo fall into ſinne. Laſtly, he forgetteth himſelfe much when he ſaith, <hi>that it is good to be tempted:</hi> for he holdeth for certaine, that the very firſt motions to ſinne in vs (which is the beginning of the temptation) are mortal ſinnes; and ſo by himſelfe, it is good to fall into mortall ſinne, if it be good we ſhould be tempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>this clauſe</hi> (Amen) <hi>ſignifieth a ſpeciall faith concerning all the former petitions, that they ſhall be graunted, and therefore a ſpeciall faith concerning remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſignifieth a ſpeciall hope and confidence to obtaine them, but no certainety of faith, vnleſſe vpon a condition which is vncertaine: that is, if we doe our partes, God will not faile of his; if we doe hartily repent vs, and vſe the Sacrament of Penance duly, we ſhall aſſuredly obtaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes. Hitherto M. PER. hath argued againſt vs out of the Lordes praier: nowe I will briefly ſhewe howe the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrarieth it.</p>
            <p>I haue in my anſwere to his objections, touched ſome points already: I adde, that one poſition of their doctrine croſſeth three of the firſt petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I proue it thus: In euery petition we muſt be aſſured (as M. PER. hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) or at the leaſt haue a good hope to obtaine that we pray for, or elſe it booteth vs not to pray: but according to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doctrine no man can be aſſured, nay can haue any hope to obtaine the three firſt petitions: for if originall ſinne doe continually dwell in vs, and infect all our actions with deadly ſinne as they teach; <hi>Gods name cannot be ſanctified in vs,</hi> that are infected with ſuch an vncleane leproſie: neither ſecondly, can <hi>God raigne as a King in vs,</hi> if ſinne poſſeſſe &amp; command all our members: and thirdly, <hi>Gods wil cannot be done by vs on earth as it is done in heauen,</hi> if we cannot keepe his lawes and commandements, which they in heauen doe: wherefore the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> haue no aſſurance to obtaine the three firſt petitions, who are by their teachers aſſured, that they are not to be expected or hoped for: nor they cannot (according to their owne rules) from their hart make the ſaid petitions, being out of all hope to obtaine them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the fourth, we aſke</hi> aſwell to be made partakers of Chriſtes bleſſed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23774:121"/> body in the Sacrament, which is the food of our ſoules: as for our daylie corporal ſuſteinance. For ſo doe the ancient Fathers expound that peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as namely <hi>S. Ciprian</hi> in oratione Dominica: <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in 6. <hi>Mathaei: S. Ambroſe li.</hi> 5. <hi>de Sacrament. c.</hi> 4. where he hath theſe memorable wordes of the bleſſed Sacrament: <hi>that before the wordes of Christ it was bread, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is the body of Chriſt. Why then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is it called here bread?</hi> he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>that it is called bread not ſimply, but ſuperſubſtantiall bread.</hi> For ſo doth the greeke word <hi>Epióusion</hi> ſignifie, as well as daylie:) <hi>it is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not ſuch bread as paſſeth into our body, but it is the bread of eternal life that vpholdeth the ſubſtance of our ſoules.</hi> Nowe you may be well aſſured, that <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> who will not beleeue any ſuch bodily preſence, doe not pray to God to giue it them.</p>
            <p>And touching <hi>forgiueneſſe of their debts</hi> to God, and ſinnes; they are ſo aſſured of that before hand, by the certainety of their new faith, that they can no more requeſt of God forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, then they can aſke, that God will make them reaſonable creatures, which they ſee that he hath done already. And they holding the firſt motions to euil in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to be mortall ſinnes, which no mortall man ordinarily can nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void; howe can they pray God <hi>not to ſuffer them to be lead into temptation,</hi> when they teach it to be impoſſible to eſcape the venime of it? And if they vnderſtand it ſo, as M. PERKINS teacheth: to wit, <hi>that they there pray, not to be left to the malice of Satan,</hi> they cannot <hi>without loſſe of the certainety of their faith</hi> pray ſo; becauſe they hold themſelues aſſured of that before hand.</p>
            <p>Neither can they pray God generally <hi>to deliuer them from all euill,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as they doe, that we muſt needes fall into mortall ſinne at euery ſtep almoſt, which is the greateſt of all other euill. And finally; if it belong to God <hi>to deliuer vs from ſinne,</hi> and all other <hi>euill;</hi> then <hi>Caluin</hi> and his followers doe wickedly blaſpheame, who teach God to be the authour and worker in vs, of all errour, ſinne, and wickednes. Thus much of the <hi>Pater noſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe before I come to the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> I may not omit to ſpeake a word of the <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> which in old <hi>Catechiſmes</hi> followeth immediately after the <hi>Pater noster.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> haue caſſierd it, and may not abide to heare it once ſaid; but therein, as much as in any other ſuch matter, they diſgrace their doctrine and diſcredite themſelues. For all the wordes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of old therein, are the very wordes of the holy Ghoſt, regiſtred in <hi>S. Lukes</hi> Goſpell; and therefore they bewray either great ignorance, or a wicked ſpirit to dwell in them, that cannot indure to heare the wordes of Gods ſpirit.<note place="margin">

I need not in ſuch cleare euidence of Gods word, alleage the teſtimony of any ancient Father: he that liſt to ſee howe it hath beene vſed in the pureſt antiquity, let him read <hi>S.</hi> Athanaſius <hi>in euang. de deipara</hi> S.

               <hi>Anſwere.</hi> He beganne to ſet downe the inſtitution of the Sacrament out of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. here he leapeth backe to <hi>S. Mathewe,</hi> becauſe he fitteth him better in this point: to vvhome I anſwere, that Chriſt there ſpake only vnto his twelue Apoſtles, vvho vvere afterward to adminiſter that holy Sacrament to others; and ſo ſome thing there-about is ſpoken to them, vvhich may not be extended vnto lay-men, but vnto <hi>Prieſtes</hi> only, who were to ſucceed the Apoſtles in that miniſtery. All men doe confeſſe theſe vvordes: <hi>hoc facite, doe ye this:</hi> that is, adminiſter ye this Sacrament, to be ſpoken only to the Apoſtles, and in them to all of the Clergie alone: euen ſo, <hi>drinke ye al of this,</hi> was in like manner ſpoken vnto them only as Clergiemen; and therefore it is a commandement only to <hi>Prieſtes</hi> ſo to doe: and as for others, they may either drinke of it, or not drinke of it, as it ſhall be thought moſt expedient by their ſupreame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; and this may be gathered out of thoſe very wordes, <hi>drinke ye al of this.</hi> For why ſhould the Apoſtles haue a ſpeciall charge more to drinke of that cuppe, then to eate of that foode? vnles it were to ſignifie, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all men ſhould be bound to receiue Chriſtes body: they ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound to receiue that holy cuppe alſo; from which bond other men ſhould ſtand free. But to come to the purpoſe, when they quarrell with vs for taking away from the people one kinde of the Sacrament: we anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, that vve doe them no hinderance thereby; becauſe vve giue them both the bleſſed body &amp; ſacred bloud of Chriſt together vnder one kind: yea, whole Chriſt, both God and man; becauſe they be ſo vnited that they cannot be ſeparated. But what can they anſwere, when we complaine vpon them, for that they haue defrauded the poore people, of both body and bloud of Chriſt, and in lieu of that moſt pretious banquet, doe giue them a cold breake-faſt, of <hi>a morſel of bread</hi> &amp; <hi>a ſuppe of wine?</hi> this is a moſt miſerable &amp; lamentable exchange in deede: our bleſſed Lord giue them grace to ſee it, &amp; deliuer them ſpeedily from it. Here is the place to ſhew, how the <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> doe not only bereaue their vnfortunate folowers of this moſt heauenly foode of Chriſtes body: but that they alſo depriue them of the manifold &amp; great graces of God, deriued vnto vs in 5. other <hi>ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts:</hi> but becauſe I haue touched it in the <hi>Preface,</hi> I wil omit it here, and make an end with M. PER. aſſoone as I haue requited him, by propounding briefly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23774:123"/> ſome arguments for the <hi>real preſence,</hi> as he hath done againſt it. Let this be the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The ſtate of the <hi>newe Teſtament,</hi> which is more perfect then the <hi>old,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth accordingly Sacraments of greater grace and perfection then the <hi>old</hi> had: they had <hi>Manna,</hi> which for ſubſtance and taſte farre paſſed our bread, and in ſignification was equall to it: Wherefore, either vve muſt graunt our Sacrament of bread and wine, to be inferiour to theirs of the <hi>old Teſtament;</hi> or elſe acknowledge and confeſſe it to be the true <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> of Chriſt, which doth ſurpaſſe theirs exceedingly, as the body doth the ſhadowe. This argument is confirmed by our Sauiour himſelfe, who in expreſſe tearmes doth <hi>preferre the meate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 48.49.</note> 
               <hi>that he was to giue to his Diſciples, before that of</hi> Manna, <hi>which their Fathers had eaten in the wilderneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſt promiſed to giue to his Diſciples his <hi>fleſh to eate,</hi> and <hi>his bloud to drinke:</hi> and when they marueiled howe that could be, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them;<note place="margin">Ibid. v. <hi>55</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that vnleſſe they did eate his fleſh, they ſhould not haue life in them;</hi> and further certified them, <hi>that his fleſh was truly meate,</hi> and <hi>his bloud truly drinke:</hi> vvhence it is moſt plainely deduced, that he who neuer faileth of his promiſe, gaue them his true <hi>fleſh</hi> to eate.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Chriſt ſaid in moſt cleare tearmes, <hi>this is my body: this is my bloud.</hi> What could be more certaine or more perſpicuous?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Theſe vvordes of the inſtitution are recorded by three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts, and by <hi>S. Paul:</hi> and they al vniformely deliuer it to be not the figure of Chriſts body, <hi>but his body;</hi> and that his body <hi>which ſhould be giuen for our redemption on the croſſe: ergo,</hi> it was that his true reall body, vvhich vvas nailed to the croſſe for vs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, <hi>S. Paul</hi> demandeth thus: <hi>the Chalice of benediction which we doe bleſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>is it not the communication of the bloud of Christ? and the bread that we breake, is it not the participation of the body of our Lord?</hi> if then we doe in receiuing the bleſſed Sacrament <hi>participate Chriſtes body, and communicate his bloud,</hi> they ſurely are there really preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Againe, <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>He that eateth and drinketh vnworthely, eateth and drinketh judgement to himſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28.</note> 
               <hi>not diſcerning the body of our Lord:</hi> and before, <hi>is guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt: ergo,</hi> the body and bloud of Chriſt are there preſent; or elſe why ſhould a man incurre that guilt, but by his vnworthy receiuing of it, and by not diſcerning Chriſtes body to be there preſent?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Beſides all theſe plaine textes of holy Scripture in confirmation of the reall preſence, the very circumſtances of it doe much fortifie our faith therein.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lucae</hi> 22. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</note> In <hi>S. Luke</hi> vve haue, that our Sauiour marueillouſly deſired <hi>(deſiderio deſideraui)</hi> to eate that this laſt banquet vvith his Diſciples.

               </note> 
               <hi>vnto the end he loued them: and knowing that the Father gaue al thinges into his handes, and that he came from God, and goeth to God, &amp;c.</hi> What coherence (I ſay) with this exceeding loue and infinit power of Chriſt, to be ſhewed in his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if he hath left only bread and vvine to be taken in remembrance of him? any meane man might eaſily haue done as much; and <hi>Helias</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his Diſciple <hi>Heliſeus,</hi> did much more: for he left a more noble remembrance of himſelfe behind him, to wit: his <hi>cloake</hi> and <hi>double spirit.</hi> But Chriſt bequeathing vs his true natural body to be the foode of our ſoules, and comfort of our hartes as we beleeue &amp; teach, he then (in deede) ſhewed his infinit power and loue towardes vs, and <hi>that he came from God,</hi> and as God beſtowed an ineſtimable gift vpon vs, ſuch a one as neuer any other did, or could poſſibly doe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Moreouer, the inſtitution of a religious rite and ceremony, to be vſed in the whole Church vnto the worldes end, and to be receiued of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people of age and diſcretion, did neceſſarily require that it ſhould be done in moſt certaine and cleare tearmes; otherwiſe, there might ariſe great ſtrife and contention about it, and be the ruine of thouſandes. And ſpecially great perſpicuity is required in this holy Sacrament, where the miſtaking of it, muſt needes breede either Idolatry, if vve vvorſhippe for Chriſt, that which is not Chriſt: or impiety, if on the other ſide we ſhould not giue to it (being Chriſt God and man) diuine honour. Wherefore, no good Chriſtian may thinke, but that our prouident Sauiour Chriſt IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS, vvho very vvell foreſawe all theſe inconueniences, did deliuer it in ſuch tearmes as he would haue to be taken properly, and not be conſtrued at mens pleaſures figuratiuely. Adde, that he ſpake thoſe wordes to the twelue Apoſtles only, vvhome he vvas accuſtomed to inſtruct plainely, and not in parable darkely; and who were wont alſo to aſke for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of obſcure ſpeaches, vvho here made no queſtion about this high miſtery, becauſe they were ſufficiently forewarned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>that they ſhould eate Christes fleſh,</hi> and <hi>that his body was truly meate:</hi> and therefore beleeued Chriſtes wordes without further queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Finally, this holy Sacrament is a principall part of the <hi>newe Teſtament,</hi> and one of the chiefeſt legacies by Chriſt bequeathed vnto vs Chriſtians. Nowe what lawe or conſcience will permit, that any legacy ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted figuratiuely? to vvit: that for a houſe, goodes, or landes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed and giuen by laſt vvill and teſtament; you ſhould vnderſtand a figure of a houſe to be giuen, or the ſignification and repreſentation of ſome goodes or landes. If this be moſt abſurd and ridiculous in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of any ordinary man, about temporall goodes: howe much more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23774:124"/> pernitious and intollerable is it, to ſuffer this in the eternall Teſtament of the Sonne of God, and that in his diuine and ineſtimable treaſures? And thus at length by the grace of God I come to the end of this booke, wherein <hi>(good Christian reader)</hi> if thou finde any thing, that may confirme thee in the true <hi>Catholike</hi> faith, or further thy knowledge therein; giue God (the Father of lightes, from whome all good giftes deſcend) the whole praiſe: If any thing be amiſſe, impute it partly to my ſlender ſkill, ouerſight, or negligence; and partly to the vvant of a conuenient reſting-place, commodity of bookes, and conference: all vvhich, theſe times of perſecution doe depriue vs of.</p>
